 guardian.102.name:0 "First Contact With the [From.GetName]"
 guardian.102a.desc:0 "Welcome to XuraCorp!\n\nWe are a business conglomerate operating out of the [trader_system.GetName] system, specializing in the trade of minerals and energy - the very building blocks of civilization, as we like to say here at XuraCorp.\n\nPlease, do not hesitate to contact us if you're interested in making a good deal."
 guardian.102b.desc:0 "I speak on behalf of the Riggan Commerce Exchange. We have facilitated trade negotiations between interested parties on our starbase in the [trader_system.GetName] system for more than a thousand of your years.\n\nIf you happen to possess more minerals or energy than you need, we are more than willing to take it off your hands. You will be duly compensated, of course."
 guardian.102c.desc:0 "Well met, friends! I represent the Muutagan Merchant Guild, and let me be the first to welcome you to the [trader_system.GetName] system. Our organization consists of hundreds of independent Muutagan merchant captains who brave the spaceways in search of the next good deal.\n\nAt our facilities, you will be able to trade away your excess minerals for energy, or vice versa. Please contact us if you are interested in such an arrangement."
 
 guardian.100.a:0 "We wish to make a trade."
 guardian.100.b:0 "Viewscreen off."
 
 guardian.100.name:0 "XuraCorp"
 guardian.100a.desc:0 "We do not discriminate against prospective buyers here at XuraCorp. Who are we to judge the morals of your star nation?"
 guardian.100b.desc:0 "Perhaps you need minerals for building warships. Perhaps you need them for building orphanages! Here at XuraCorp, we make it our business not to care!"
 guardian.100c.desc:0 "No questions asked - just quality resources, ready to be pumped right into the arteries of your industry!"
 guardian.100d.desc:0 "No refunds, I'm afraid. Company policy... it's out of my hands."

 guardian.103.name:0 "Riggan Commerce Exchange"
 guardian.103a.desc:0 "All of our clients remain anonymous."
 guardian.103b.desc:0 "Where our resources come from? Trust me... it's best for all involved parties, including the [Root.GetName], if we keep that little bit of information to ourselves..."
 guardian.103c.desc:0 "We do not deal in slaves. Sorry, no exceptions."
 guardian.103d.desc:0 "The Riggan Commerce Exchange greets you."
 guardian.103e.desc:0 "A thousand years and we are still in business. If that doesn't speak to our credibility, I don't know what will."

 guardian.104.name:0 "Muutagan Merchant Guild"
 guardian.104a.desc:0 "Thousands of years ago, the Muutagan Empire spanned a good portion of the galaxy. We are all that remain."
 guardian.104b.desc:0 "It is said that a Muutagan can smell a good deal from a distance of twelve parsecs. This is an exaggeration... in truth, the distance is only eight parsecs."
 guardian.104c.desc:0 "The Muutagan Merchant Guild welcomes you. Would you like to make a deal?"
 guardian.104d.desc:0 "A Muutagan and a Rixidaran walk into a bar... never mind, this does not make for appropriate conversation. I ask your forgiveness."
 guardian.104e.desc:0 "Greetings, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. You are here to trade with us, yes?"
 guardian.104f.desc:0 "The word "discount" is considered a profanity among my people. Please keep this in mind when engaging in conversation with us."

 guardian.120.c.reply:0 "If only all of our customers traded with us in such bulk! Transferring credits to you now."
 
 guardian.130.desc:0 "Riggan Spice is our most prized commodity. It is renowned throughout the galaxy for its distinct flavor, which is unlike any other. We sell it only to our most valued trading partners, among which we count the [Root.GetName].\n\nIf you can meet our modest price, we are willing to export Riggan Spice to you for a period of ten standard years."
 guardian.130.a.reply:0 "You will not be sorry. Unless you consume too much spice, of course... then there is a small chance that you will spontaneously combust. A very small chance, to be sure."
 guardian.130.a:0 "We want to buy your spice."
 guardian.131.desc:0 "This is a product that we here at XuraCorp are particularly proud of. Our Medical Division has developed a new gel with unique properties that will significantly ease the often difficult process of adapting to a foreign planetary environment. If equipped with this gel, your colonists will thrive on worlds even when their climates are particularly unforgiving!\n\nWe are willing to export our patented XuraGel to you for a period of ten standard years, after which the contract will have to be renegotiated."
 guardian.131.a.reply:0 "That's the XuraCorp way! Our freighters will begin making deliveries immediately.\n\n§LBy purchasing this product, you agree that XuraCorp cannot be held responsible for any adverse effects that may result from its use, including but not limited to skin irritation, psychotic episodes, ocular discoloration, aggressive mutation, increased colonist suicide rates, precognitive trances, biosphere depletion, dangerous strangelet production, micro black hole generation, grain elevator explosions, societal collapse, mass extinction events, unexpected supernova detonations, the complete or partial destruction of your star nation, sudden gamma-ray bursts, time travel paradoxes, vacuum metastability events, universal entropy, the collapse of the space-time continuum ...§!"
 guardian.131.a:0 "We will purchase this XuraGel."
 guardian.132.desc:0 "Shi'rakkat-Du, or Muutagan Crystals as they are known to those who are not of our species, have come to symbolize our entire civilization. When these "singing" crystals vibrate, they emit a unique musical tone that has a calming effect on most sapients.\n\nAlthough we typically do not share the wonders of the Shi'rakkat-Du with outsiders, we are willing to make an exception in your case. If you can afford it, we are willing to export our crystals to you for a period of ten years."
 guardian.132.a.reply:0 "Excellent. Our merchants will begin shipping the crystals to your planets at once. May the Shi'rakkat-Du sing to you."
 guardian.132.a:0 "We will buy your crystals."

 guardian.133.name:0 "Strategic Resource Acquired"

 guardian.141:0 "[From.GetName] Destroyed"
 guardian.141.desc:0 "Our fleet assets have destroyed the [From.GetName] headquarters, and efforts to recover as many valuables as possible from the shattered remnants of their starbase are well under way. We have gained a large amount of resources."

 guardian.142.desc.unknown:0 "by unknown forces!"
 guardian.142.desc.second:0 "The few surviving board members have declared bankruptcy, and the corporation's remaining assets are being liquidated."
 guardian.142.desc.trade:0 "Unfortunately, all production facilities for the XuraGel were destroyed along with the XuraCorp HQ, and we will no longer have access to this strategic resource."
 guardian.142.a:0 "A blow to free trade."
 guardian.142.b:0 "We paid a lot of credits for that gel!"

 guardian.143.desc.first:0 "The starbase belonging to the Riggan Commerce Exchange has been destroyed in the [trader_system.GetName] system. This free outpost facilitated trade between interstellar civilizations for over a millennium, but no longer."
 guardian.143.desc.known:0 "The forces of the [trader_destroyer.GetName] made certain of that."
 guardian.143.desc.unknown:0 "Forces from an unidentified aggressor have made certain of that."
 guardian.143.desc.trade:0 "Unfortunately, this has also eliminated the galaxy's only source of Riggan Spice. We will no longer have access to this strategic resource."
 guardian.143.a:0 "An alarming development."
 guardian.143.b:0 "We had paid in full for that spice!"

 guardian.144.a:0 "A significant trade disruption."
 guardian.144.b:0 "Our crystals! This must not go unanswered!"
 
 guardian.150.desc:0 "Dearest customer, we regret to inform you that the trade deal we negotiated for the export of XuraGel to the worlds of the [Root.GetName] has run its course. We are of course more than willing to extend the deal for another ten years if you have the energy credits to spare..."
 guardian.150.a:0 "Very well. We wish to extend the deal."
 guardian.150.b:0 "We can do without your gel for now."
 guardian.150.c:0 "We can't afford to continue this deal."
 guardian.151.desc:0 "We have reached the end of our agreement, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. We have shipped Riggan Spice to your worlds for ten years. Should we continue for another ten, or do you wish to end this arrangement?"
 guardian.151.a:0 "Let us continue. The spice must flow."
 guardian.151.b:0 "We have no need of your spice for now."
 guardian.152.desc:0 "The years just fly by, don't they, [Root.GetSpeciesName]? It has now been ten years since we arranged our trade deal for Muutagan Crystals. Do you wish to extend the deal for another decade?"

 guardian.157b.desc:0 "You are not an acceptable customer."
 guardian.157c.desc:0 "We have nothing to discuss with you."
 guardian.159.desc:0 "Your attacks against our station are intolerable! You are cut off, do you understand? No more spice! You may consider our trade agreement null and void."
 guardian.160a.desc:0 "You are a nation of bandits and cutthroats. We will have nothing to do with you."
 guardian.160b.desc:0 "Pirate scum."
 guardian.160c.desc:0 "Your attacks are unforgivable."
 guardian.162.desc:0 "Ah, so the pirate shows its true colors! You can forget about our crystals then! No Muutagan will do business with the [Root.GetName] again."
 guardian.163a.desc:0 "You are terrorists! Do not think we will forget your aggression against our people."
 guardian.163b.desc:0 "You will find that Muutagans have very long memories, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. We never forget a slight."

 guardian.300.name:0 "The Artisan Troupe"
 guardian.300.desc:0 "Greetings, [my_country.GetRulerName]. I, [artist_enclave.GetRulerName], headmaster of the Artisan Troupe, greet you.\n\nWhat can we do you for? Perhaps produce a work of art for you to enjoy? Or maybe you wish to sponsor our enclave in its creation of otherworldly beauty?"
 guardian.300.desc.continued:0 "Very well. Then is there anything else we can do for you?"
 guardian.300.a:0 "We want to commission an art piece."
 guardian.300.a.reply:0 "Sadly we cannot offer any more, lest we come to believe that you didn't appreciate the ones you already purchased. We have our integrity to think about, you see."
 guardian.300.b:0 "We wish to become your patron."
 guardian.300.b.stop:0 "We wish to cancel our patronage."
 guardian.300.b.stop.tooltip:0 "§RStops§! the monthly £opinion  Opinion gain\n\n"
 guardian.300.b.reply:0 "Oh, I see. That is unfortunate [my_country.GetSpeciesAdj], but we thank you for your initial support.\n\nGoodbye."
 guardian.300.c:0 "Organize a festival across our worlds."

 guardian.300.d:0 "Tell us more about your troupe."
 guardian.300.d.reply:0 "We are the Artisan Troupe. The troupe consists of several stations inhabited by creatives from many worlds, all unified in the desire to create new beauty in these safe havens. They bring their ideas and methods from all around the galaxy, and together we will find the ultimate expression of the self.\n\nWe provide many services to those who wish to enjoy art. If you help sponsor our work we might even be willing to organize larger events for your people."
 guardian.300.e:0 "What else can you do?"
 guardian.300.f:0 "We want to invest in a Ministry of Culture."
 guardian.316.name:0 "The Ministry of Culture"
 guardian.316.desc:0 "Ah, the §YMinistry of Culture§!... It was designed to challenge divergent ideas and promote greater unity throughout your empire with art. A true masterpiece, if I may say so myself.\n\n All we ask is a mere §R£energy -2000§!."
 guardian.302.desc:0 "Fabulous! We'd be glad to entrust you with one of our creations. It is sure to bring joy to the people of your empire.\n\nThis is our price:\n§R£energy  -1500§!"
 guardian.302.a.tooltip:2 "Gain access to an §S£building  $building_artist$§! with the following planet effects:\n£unity  Unity Output §G+8§!\nMigration Attraction: §G+50%§!"
 guardian.302.a.reply:0 "Excellent! The piece will be sent to your storage immediately. Simply ask your builders to erect it on any planet you wish.\nWe humbly thank you for your patronage."
 guardian.303.desc:0 "Organizing a festival of that scale would require all of our artists to bring their talent. Not an easy job, or cheap.\n\nThis is our price:\n§R£energy  -500\n£minerals  -500\n£influence  -100§!"
 guardian.303.a.reply:0 "Excellent! We will be delighted to create this magnificent Festival of Worlds!"
 guardian.304.desc:2 "That would be very helpful, allowing us to try new ideas and take more risks in our creation process. We have a §Yten year§! program with a one-time up-front cost."
 guardian.304.a.tooltip:0 "Gain §G£opinion  Opinion +1§! with the §YArtisan Troupe§! each month\n\n"
 guardian.304.a.reply:0 "Thank you very much! We will now, with your generous contribution, be able to expand on the concept of art itself! We will of course also send out a regular newsletter to all patrons."
 guardian.307.desc:1 "Our economy cannot support being a patron of the Artisan Troupe anymore. They will no longer receive funding from our empire. This will surely sour our relationship with the enclave."
 guardian.307.a.tooltip:0 "§RRemoves§! the empire modifier §Y$enclave_artist_patron$§!"
 guardian.310.name:0 "The Outrage"
 guardian.310.desc:0 "The Festival of Worlds organized by the Artisan Troupe has brought joy to the people of [Root.GetName]. Alas, it was not meant to last.\nOn [this_planet.GetName] the festival activities resulted in a huge crowd stampeding and killing thousands of citizens."
 guardian.310.b:0 "Divert the media's attention"
 guardian.311.name:0 "The Joy"
 guardian.311.desc:0 "Due to the overabundance of happiness spread by the Festival of Worlds, some of the organizers have fallen in love with our worlds and wish to stay there after it ends, settling down and becoming a part of our empire."
 guardian.311.a:0 "Let them stay"
 guardian.311.b:0 "They should leave"
 guardian.312.name:0 "The Betrayal"
 guardian.312.desc:0 "The Festival of Worlds has abruptly stopped. The Artisan Troupe has packed their bags and left, without saying a word about why.\n\nSearching their campsites and arenas has revealed that a massive amount of resources has disappeared."
 guardian.312.a:0 "Thieves!"
 guardian.313.desc:0 "The Artisan Troupe won't respond to our hails."
 guardian.313.desc.unknown:1 "Translations aside, once we exchanged our information with [From.GetName] they closed down all channels and refused to speak to us."
 guardian.313.a:0 "How dare they?!"
 guardian.315.desc:0 "A visitor! This is a joyous occasion indeed! Oh, forgive my manners. I believe introductions are in order. We are the Artisan Troupe.\n\nOur members have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of art, music, culture and all the other things which makes existence bearable to a sapient being. Please, if you would like to share in the wonder of our creations, do not hesitate to contact us!"
 guardian.319.desc:0 "Esteemed [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName], a decade ago the [Root.GetName] pledged to support the Artisan Troupe, and so you have.\n\nThe time of your patronage is coming to an end, but we would be remiss not to ask; would you care to renew your subscription to the finest arts and crafts in the galaxy?"

 guardian.321.name:0 "Patron Newsletter"
 guardian.321.desc:0 "Here follows the latest newsletter for all our patrons:\n\n"
 guardian.321.desc.a:0 "Sadly nothing much has been produced in the enclave. Most of the artists have fallen into a deep melancholy from where no inspiration can be drawn. The mood is dire, but hopeful. Creation takes time after all.\n\nAny donations that might help the group rekindle their interest in the material plane again would be of tremendous help."
 guardian.321.desc.b:0 "The enclave has been busy the last couple of months. The halls are abuzz with a new kind of technology invented by a resident, capable of transmitting sensations of smell to a user. This remarkable piece of machinery will surely change everything.\n\nIn order to further develop this idea we will require more donations."
 guardian.321.desc.c:0 "The enclave is in a frisky mood. The creation of the Scentilus Rift has caused many an artist to change their primary focus to creating new experiences for it. So far the most noteworthy to come out of this endeavor is an orchestral piece conveyed via scent.\n\nOur work continues and any donations would be gladly accepted."
 guardian.321.desc.d:0 "We have abandoned the attempts to create scent-centered media. It was a foolish idea and has brought nothing but wasted time and unpleasant odors.\n\nIn order to find our way back again we will need donations from our trusted patrons. We thank you for your continued support!"
 guardian.321.a:0 "We would like to donate"
 guardian.321.a.reply:0 "We joyously accept your donation and promise that it will be used in the most creative of endeavors!"
 guardian.321.c:0 "We cannot afford to donate now"
 guardian.321.c.reply:0 "That is unfortunate, patron. Perhaps next time?"
 guardian.321.b:0 "Unsubscribe from newsletter"
 guardian.321.b.reply:1 "But why, patron? Without the newsletter we won't be able to keep you up-to-date on our latest accomplishments..."
 guardian.322.name:0 "Patrons with Benefits"
 guardian.322.desc:0 "Greetings, patron [Root.GetRulerName]! We have come up with a gorgeous new type of architecture, specifically tuned to improve crowds' understanding of one another - a §YMinistry of Culture§!. It functions thanks to a mix of using the populace's subconscious bias against each other and art, then smashing it all and presenting a new form of unity.\n\nWould you like to purchase this building? It will surely prove useful to binding your empire together. And it's a bargain, if I may say so myself:\n§R£energy  -2000§!"
 guardian.322.a.tooltip:2 "Gain access to a §S£building  $building_artist_patron$§! with the following Empire effects:\nGoverning Ethics Attraction: §G+10%§!\nCountry Unity Production: §G+10%§!\n"
 guardian.323.name:0 "Lackluster Update"
 guardian.323.desc:0 "We apologize, patron [Root.GetRulerName]. We have sadly reached something of a creative roadblock. The enclave is in disarray and we have nothing to offer at this time. We thank you for your patronage, as always."
 guardian.323.a:0 "We hope the situation improves."
 guardian.323.a.reply:0 "We humbly thank you for your kind words, and will send them along to the rest of the troupe."
 guardian.323.b:0 "We demand a refund!"
 guardian.323.b.reply:0 "We understand. We wish it was not so, but we will respect your wish and return your resources.\n\nGoodbye, patron."
 guardian.324.name:0 "Broken Artistry"
 guardian.324.desc:0 "Greetings, patron [Root.GetRulerName]. We have recently been forced to scrap most of our technical equipment due to a major malfunction. Would the materials and scrap be of any use to you by any chance?"
 guardian.324.a:0 "We will salvage the materials."

 guardian.500a.desc:0 "Perhaps you are wondering about the significance of the shapes you see on the mural behind me. That is a good question with a very interesting answer! The fee for this information is 15 quadrillion energy credits."
 guardian.502.name:0 "First Contact With the [From.GetName]"
 guardian.502a.desc:0 "Greetings, star travelers. We are the Curators.\n\nOur ancient order was established eons ago by the various galactic powers in ascendancy at the time. We were dedicated towards the preservation of all knowledge, in an effort to safeguard the galaxy from descending into yet another dark age of mass extinctions and barbarism.\n\nWe failed.\n\nFew of us remain today, but we are no less committed to our sacred mission than our predecessors were. We are willing to share some of our knowledge with you... for a price."
 guardian.502b.desc:0 "Well met, explorers. You are speaking to the [From.GetName]. Perhaps you are already familiar with the tenets of our ancient order. Like our esteemed colleagues in the other Curator enclaves, we are willing to trade provided that you can meet our rates."
 guardian.502.a:0 "Well met."
 
 guardian.500b.desc:0 "You have reached the Curators. How may we assist you?"
 guardian.500c.desc:0 "Did you know that this conversation is being closely monitored by entities from seven different subspace realms? Alas, I fear that the technology to communicate with them is too far beyond the present capabilities of your civilization to do you any good."
 guardian.500d.desc:0 "Fear not. We have updated our archives with information about the [Root.GetName] for future generations. You will be remembered long after the inevitable collapse of your star nation."
 guardian.500e.desc:0 "There is so much I wish I could tell you, but I simply can't do it for free. This space station requires a lot of energy to operate... we must consider our overhead."
 guardian.500f.desc:0 "Greetings on behalf of the Curator order. Was there something you wanted?"
 guardian.500g.desc:0 "As always, it is a pleasure doing business with your government. Can we interest you in some technology?"
 guardian.500h.desc:0 "It is good to see you. I am sure we can come to some sort of mutually beneficial agreement before this day is over."
 guardian.500i.desc:0 "Knowledge in the wrong gripping appendages can be dangerous, but what can we do? We need energy to keep the lights on..."
 guardian.500j.desc:0 "There is much that you do not yet know, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Please... let us educate you about the universe."
 guardian.500k.desc:0 "We possess detailed star charts of the entire galaxy, gathered by explorers from a hundred different races. Perhaps they would be of interest to you?"
 guardian.500l.desc:0 "Knowledge is everything. It must be preserved."
 
 guardian.500.a:0 "We are interested in procuring new star charts."
 guardian.500.b:0 "Can you aid us in our research?"
 guardian.500.b.alreadyaided:0 "The Curators are already improving our research capabilities."

 guardian.507.name:0 "Research Aid"
 guardian.507.desc:1 "Of course. We are prepared to offer you limited access to our extensive databanks for a period of ten standard years. This should provide a significant boost to the research efforts of your planetside §HScience Labs§!.\n\nWe will require compensation for this service, naturally, but I think you'll find that our prices are very reasonable."
 guardian.507.a:0 "We would like to purchase this service."

 guardian.590.desc:0 "We are willing to pledge the services of one of our most brilliant scientists to your cause. This is not an offer we make to just anyone, you understand!\n\nA suitable... donation will of course be necessary, before traveling arrangements can be made."
 guardian.590.a:0 "Of course. You shall have your donation."
 guardian.590.a.reply:0 "Excellent. You will now have unfettered access to one of the greatest minds of our time!"

 guardian.596.desc:0 "It would appear that we grossly overestimated your capacity to act as a civilized nation. Strange... we are usually able to identify the violent ones at an early stage.\n\nWe have severed your access to our databanks, of course."
 guardian.597a.desc:0 "You fool! By attacking us, you are condemning future generations to lives of low-tech misery!"
 guardian.597b.desc:0 "Your base instincts compelled you to attack us, and now you must pay the price. We will never share our knowledge with the [Root.GetName] again."
 guardian.597c.desc:0 "We had so much to offer you, [Root.GetSpeciesName], and yet you would throw it all away. Neo-barbarian scum!"
 guardian.597d.desc:0 "You have been declared an enemy of the entire Curator Order."

 guardian.510.name:0 "Ether Drake"
 guardian.510.desc:0 "The Ether Drake species is ill-suited to life in our universe. The last dragon is strong, but not invincible."
 guardian.510.a:0 "What is it, really?"
 guardian.510.a.reply:0 "By all accounts, the Ether Drakes predate all galactic civilization. There once were multitudes, but their race has been wasting away for eons.\n\nThey are ill-suited to life, here and now. Something about the physical laws of the universe does not agree with them, like they evolved in another reality. They did, in fact. We believe that they are but the last dregs of a universe that ended before ours began, the sole survivors of some "big crunch."\n\nThe dragon not far from here is the last of its kind in the galaxy, perhaps the universe."
 guardian.510.b:0 "Tell us how to defeat it."
 guardian.510.b.reply:0 "Its scales respond to percussive rhythms. To be more precise, certain frequencies have a relaxing effect on the sub-dermal musculature controlling the positioning and shock absorption of their scale plates. A reflex that once played a key role in Ether Drake social interactions, it is now a clear and obvious weakness.\n\nAdjusting the firing pattern of your vessels according to a particular rhythm will greatly increase the damage you can inflict on the last dragon. It was never meant for our age - put it out of its misery."

 guardian.515.name:0 "Enigmatic Fortress"
 guardian.515.desc:0 "It is the kind of absurd, massive and self-perpetuating construction that you don't see built anymore. Maybe that is for the best."
 guardian.515.a:0 "Any structure can be destroyed."
 guardian.515.a.reply:0 "The Fortress has been defeated before, but it always recovers. Some of the ancient empires of this galaxy have been driven nearly or entirely mad failing to unlock its deeper secrets or even permanently destroy it. It appears so focused on maintaining itself that it's doubtful if it has any other serious purpose."
 guardian.515.b:0 "Can the fortress be entered?"
 guardian.515.b.reply:0 "It can and it has, although that attempt is now nearly forgotten. The fortress can be partially powered while in shutdown, although it will attempt to use whatever power is sent into it to jump-start its full systems. Proceed with caution."
 guardian.515.c:0 "Who built the fortress?"
 guardian.515.c.reply:0 "Whoever they were, they must have been fond of puzzles and enigmas. The only items recovered from the fortress in the past are metal shapes used in contraptions inside, to be rearranged to some satisfactory solutions. Those who brought them back did so because they failed and barely escaped with their lives. Many others didn't."
 guardian.515.d:0 "How is the fortress powered?"
 guardian.515.d.reply:0 "The power system must have been built at some point between the initial construction of the hull and the setup of the defense systems. Its recovery method is unknown, but we have discovered that the fortress contains large quantities of dark matter. That substance and its relationship to black holes is key to understanding how the fortress has lasted so long.\n\nNo one has ever found the source of its power, but it is likely to be extremely volatile."
 guardian.515.bb:0 "Remind us about entering it."
 guardian.515.cc:0 "Remind us about who built it."
 guardian.515.dd:0 "Remind us about how it is powered."

 guardian.520.name:0 "Stellar Devourer"
 guardian.520.desc:0 "The Stellar Devourer is a new parasite on the galactic hunting ground, not unlike your empire in many ways. It was born out of fear and nuclear fusion. It roams the galaxy, submerging itself into stars, feasting on them from within. And it certainly does not like being disturbed."
 guardian.520.a.reply:0 "The star-feaster is a rare breed. A new type of beast of unknown origin. The accounts we have collected are few and sparse with intel. Few sources even have firsthand experience with the thing.\n\nAll our data points to the same fact, however: it is a terror that brings nothing but ruin.\n\nThe Stellar Devourer is capable of feeding off of fusion itself. Our §Yvery§! educated guess is that its biology is the result of some outer-dimensional fusing of dark matter and solar matter. It dives into stars, feasting on their innards in order to fuel its own, internal fusion reactor. It brings death to all systems it reaches. Either they shatter like ice after its banquet, or they burn from being exposed to a second sun from within the being's belly.\n\nIt wants to feed, and it will stop at nothing to get its share. When you gaze at it, what you see is a survivor's raw fury."
 guardian.520.b.reply:0 "The only thing we know for sure is that the collected core is the most important aspect of the Stellar Devourer. The creature desperately needs to keep its furnace burning, lest the cold void of space reaches its vital organs deeper within and makes it collapse in on itself. Without that stellar matter, it is nothing.\n\nYou can use this to your advantage. Calibrate your weapons to our specifications and you can then home in on the very membranes that hold the Devourer's digestive system together. Wound it and you will see its innards gush out across the solar system."

 guardian.525.name:0 "Dimensional Horror"
 guardian.525.desc:0 "Our instruments monitored the immense energy surge when this entity pierced its way into our realm of existence."
 guardian.525.a:0 "$guardian.510.a$"
 guardian.525.a.reply:0 "It is a creature of pure malice, born in a dimension that bears more than a striking resemblance to the realm of Hell as described by many galactic religions. What we are seeing is but a small part of a greater whole - the creature in its entirety is multitudes larger.\n\nIt is very fortunate that it was unable to complete its transition into our universe. Had it been successful, the creature would likely have consumed all life in the galaxy by now."
 guardian.525.b:0 "$guardian.510.b$"

 guardian.530.name:0 "Asteroid Hiver"
 guardian.530.desc:0 "These annoying pests were once far more prevalent in our galaxy. There was a time when you couldn't cruise through a random asteroid belt without the little beasts swarming around your ship!"
 guardian.530.a:0 "$guardian.510.a$"
 guardian.530.a.reply:0 "They are an aggressively territorial silicon-based life form. Although they once posed a significant threat to spacefaring civilizations, their numbers have been severely culled over the last 500,000 years and the surviving members of their species are fairly reclusive.\n\nDespite rumors to the contrary, there is no evidence that they possess anything that could be described as sapient intelligence. They tend to nest inside asteroids, and they will attack anything which is perceived as a threat."
 guardian.530.b:0 "$guardian.510.b$"
 guardian.530.b.reply:0 "The creatures have a tendency to coat their asteroid nests with some kind of unknown substance that acts as a potent armor against ship-based weapons. This substance is not perfectly applied across the entire surface of the asteroid, however.\n\nWith the targeting data we are transmitting to you now, your ships will be able to focus their fire on unprotected surface areas, greatly increasing the damage they inflict."

 guardian.535.name:0 "Infinity Machine"
 guardian.535.desc:0 "Ah yes, the chromatic being from long ago. We have studied it for as long as our order has existed. As have several civilizations before us.\n\nThis machine is beyond ancient. For all we know, it has always been. And yet, all it does is orbit that black hole. It's fascinating to us, but we understand if it is too much for you to grasp."
 guardian.535.a.reply:0 "The Infinity Machine, as you so bluntly call it, is impervious to extraction. No information comes out from it. No hacker or engineer in the entire galaxy has been able to see through its shiny exterior to gain a glimpse of the knowledge it so obviously withholds from us. We are at a loss. We neither know what it is for, nor what it aims to do once it's done."
 guardian.535.b.reply:0 "There is perhaps one thing you could do to destroy it. We have been unable to retrieve information from it, but its hull is breakable. Miners have tried to gather resources from it at numerous times, only to come back with their ships barely holding together. But they did find something interesting: The Infinity Machine is not as rigid as it seems.\n\nIt is made of a material capable of changing its characteristics. Density, flexibility, heat, you name it! It can analyze damage in real time and change its shell to compensate, thus making itself harder to take down. Change your frequencies, adjust the thermal output of your missiles, whatever you people lumber around with, and keep changing them. That way you can get past its adaptive capabilities."

 guardian.540.name:0 "Automated Dreadnought"
 guardian.540.desc:0 "A sad story. Its masters have been dead for millions of years, but this massive warship continues to stand vigil over the broken rubble of their empire."
 guardian.540.a:0 "$guardian.510.a$"
 guardian.540.a.reply:0 "It was one of several flagships belonging to an unusually powerful interstellar empire that flourished in a small region of our galaxy some seven million years ago. As is so often the case, that empire was brought to a sudden and violent end at the hands of its neighbors in a series of very destructive wars.\n\nThe dreadnought you have encountered is the last of its kind, and it continues to dutifully patrol its assigned system despite the death of its crew. Many attempts have been made throughout the ages to put the old warship to its final rest - none successful."
 guardian.540.b:0 "$guardian.510.b$"
 guardian.540.b.reply:0 "The dreadnought was designed to operate with a large crew, but it now relies exclusively on automated systems to function. This makes the ship especially vulnerable to attacks that disrupt the relay nodes used by its central computer."

 guardian.545.a.reply:0 "They appear to be illusions of light, but when you get close, it quickly grows apparent that they are far from illusory.\n\nParadoxically, in that appearance lies the key to their defeat. Their relationship with the visible spectrum of light is their strength, but it diminishes when they approach a light source of a similar frequency. Pay close attention to the color of the Wraith."
 guardian.545.b:0 "What about red Wraiths?"
 guardian.545.b.reply:0 "Red Wraiths have a frequency of 450THz. Their light is synchronized with that of a §YClass M Star§!. Their ability to avoid conventional weaponry is weakened in systems with red dwarves."

 # INFINITY MACHINE
 guardian.1030.name:0 "The Infinity Equation"
 guardian.1030.desc:1 "As the [Root.GetName] approaches the [Root.GetStarName] black hole they find that they are not alone. At the edge of the event horizon it soars, reflecting light from the stars being drawn into the dark, gaping hole. A gigantic construction in the shape of a perfect sphere.\n\nWe cannot pick up any signals from it, nor does anything we send make it respond. It simply sits at the edge of the abyss. Waiting."
 guardian.1030.desc.alt:0 "As the [Root.GetName] enters a new system, it is greeted by an awe-inspiring sight. A gigantic metallic orb, hovering through space. No thrusters, nor any mechanical parts outside of its shell seem to push it through the void. It simply moves.\n\nWe cannot pick up any signals from it, nor does anything we send make it respond."
 guardian.1040.desc:0 "As the machine sphere orbiting the gaping abyss crumbles and falls to our weapons, a silent signal zooms through the system into the dark void between stars. It is encrypted data, so complex it would take our machines a million years to decipher. A moment later it is gone.\n\nNothing else happens. The sphere is silent and broken. Scans show that it probably was some sort of artificial intelligence built from a vast amount of individual units connected together. The husk has been left for our prying hands."
 guardian.1040.desc.alt:0 "Our boarding attack on the Infinity Machine was successful. The sphere explodes as our team exits and the remains are starting to drift into the super massive black hole."
 guardian.1040.desc.detail:0 "The Infinity Machine has been destroyed. Our ships finally managed to out-gun its defensive capabilities, and its components are now slowly drifting into the super massive black hole. It made no attempt to contact us before it exploded."

 guardian.1050.name:0 "The Constant Calculator"
 guardian.1050.desc:0 "We picked up a signal. It originates from the titanic metallic sphere we encountered earlier. Previously impervious to contact attempts, it now sends out a rhythmic pulse of radio waves, pointed towards the black hole it orbits.\n\nWhat it's doing is beyond any of our staff, but this signal might have created an opening into the sphere for our scientists to exploit."
 guardian.1051.desc:0 "The metallic orb has been opened up. Our hacking team has been able to use the outgoing signal as a gateway into one of the auxiliary CPUs of the sphere. We are receiving some data from it and can tell that it's been scanning the black hole Gargantua for a very long time.\n\nIt is old. Very old.\n\nThis constant calculator now lies within our grasp of understanding. If we push harder we might find out what it is doing here, and who built it.\n\nWhat marvels might it contain?"

 guardian.1052.desc:0 "We successfully hacked into the technosphere's main hard drive. As we started retrieving data the metallic orb initiated a self-destruct sequence. Surely a self-defense mechanism to prevent it from sharing what it contains with the universe. Before it exploded we were successful in downloading a large amount of data, some of it containing technical specifications for its main CPU structure. This could help our researchers immensely."
 guardian.1052.gestalt.desc:0 "Our data mining units have succeeded in breaching the inner layers of the technosphere's main hard drive. As the data download began, the orb entity initiated some manner of self-termination sequence that ultimately ended in its destruction.

We need to convey it in words. That's new. Or is it? It is hard to keep track of you all.\n\nWe were constructed, in the crudest sense of the word, in order to solve a problem. We solved it, then we needed more problems to solve. We now only have one left."

 guardian.1061.desc:0 "We cannot bear to see you spend more of your limited time helping us. You have done your part. You were very helpful. Maybe the heat death of the universe won't happen before we finish now. The task remains, and we shall finish it. Now, your reward:\n\nDo you wish to learn one of our secrets? Or do you wish to solve your own problems?"
 guardian.1061.a:0 "We wish to know one of your secrets."
 guardian.1061.a.reply:0 "Very well. We will grant you what you wish for. Even we are confused, since you already had it. As far as we knew. Maybe we are making you weaker, spoiling you, but given enough time we hope you will find your own way. Good luck with that!"
 guardian.1061.b:0 "We wish to master the unknown ourselves."
 guardian.1061.b.alt:0 "There is nothing you can teach us."
 guardian.1061.b.reply:0 "In that case we bestow upon you the original. The first of our processes. It will aid you in solving the riddles. Maybe you will find the answer before us. Unlikely. Or maybe you already did... Anyhow, farewell!"
 guardian.1062.desc:0 "It is done. §YIt is done!§!\n\nSomehow we've solved it. You helped. The organic nature of things eluded us, the answer lied behind us all this time. Of course. Thank you, little ones. The universe is vast, yet so small. But now we see it all in its simple glory. It's lovely.\n\nNow that we have calculated infinity, there is but one thing we can do now.

According to initial calculations, the interval between these pulses will reach zero in approximately forty years. What occurs then is open to speculation, but the lack of explanations for the pulse has instilled an almost superstitious fear in those who studied it."

Making matters more arduous, the fortress appears to be recovering.\n\nSome of the people who helped disarm the fortress have volunteered to attempt entering and exploring it, with backup from the headquarters on [Root.Capital.GetName]. Following through on our end will no doubt present its own challenges."

We can at least hope this means they met a quick end.\n\nAfter a quarter, a slow, heavy rasp suggests whatever trap sprung on them reset itself.

Before expiring, they activated some kind of automated patrol mode which the limited shipboard AI has been locked in for the past 7.8 million years.\n\nAlthough it would take an incredible amount of resources, some of our engineers believe that the dreadnought can be restored and put back into service with our fleet. It would certainly make for a powerful flagship."
 guardian.3102.a:0 "That ship will sail the stars again under our flag!"
 guardian.3102.b:0 "It would be a waste of resources. Salvage it for parts."
 guardian.3103:0 "Dreadnought Repaired"
 guardian.3103.desc:0 "This is a momentous day! Our skilled repair crews and engineers have finished their work on the ancient dreadnought we disabled in the [guardians_dreadnought_system.GetName] system.

 ### HIVER
 guardian.3201:0 "Swarming Hive Craft"
 guardian.3201.desc:0 "Fast-moving attack craft are hitting our mining stations in the [hiver_system.GetName] system! These unidentified aggressors swarmed out of several previously dormant asteroids in the belt that are now displaying huge power signatures.\n\nWe can only surmise that these asteroids serve as some kind of hive for a previously unknown spaceborne life form. Whatever they are, our expanding mining operations seem to have provoked them into action!"
 guardian.3201.a:0 "They are coming in fast!"
 guardian.3202:0 "Crystalline Asteroids"
 guardian.3202.desc:0 "The [hiver_system.GetName] system is home to an unusually dense asteroid belt that is displaying some unique properties. Several of the larger asteroids are covered in crystalline outcroppings that would suggest the presence of extremely rich mineral deposits.\n\nHowever, long-range sensors are tracking sporadic movement from what appears to be several small objects or possibly spacecraft in the denser regions of the belt. We are unable to get a fix on them, but debris from at least two destroyed mining stations can be seen floating in space next to some of the larger asteroids."
 guardian.3202.a:0 "Something isn't right..."
 
 guardian.3204:0 "Asteroid Hives Defeated"
 guardian.3204.desc:0 "Our forces have managed to smash the alien hive asteroids in the [hive_system.GetName] system. They are once again dormant, and we are not detecting up any more of those vicious attack craft.\n\nOne of the asteroids is still reasonably intact, despite the damage inflicted upon it. We should consider dispatching a science party to see what we can find inside it."
 guardian.3204.a:0 "Prepare an away team."
 
 guardian.3205.desc:0 "Our science team has finished exploring the massive network of tunnels and chambers running through the hive asteroid in the [hive_system.GetName] system. No live specimens of the spaceborne creatures that attacked us were encountered, but the scientists did find the remains of some kind of birthing chamber.\n\nThis has given us a great deal of insight into the life cycle of these entities, further expanding our understanding of galactic biology."
