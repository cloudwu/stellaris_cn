The MegaCorpse initiative was originally developed as a psionic strike force. They would "play" difficult "venues," effectively subverting rebellious movements with overtly anti-corporate lyrics disguising subtle psionic aggression-dampening measures inflicted on the listener.\n\nUltimately, the catalytic effects of their music on the band's already-potent psionic powers soon proved too much for managers and executives to control.

 TUTORIAL_GOVERNMENTVIEW_MARKET_TITLE:0 "The Market"
 TUTORIAL_GOVERNMENTVIEW_MARKET_DESC:0 "Via the §SMarket§! screen we can buy and sell resources. At first this is merely an internal market, but if enough Empires establish contact I expect they might form some sort of §SGalactic Market§!.\n\nResources can be bought and sold using the appropriate buttons here, but be aware that buying or selling a resource will raise or lower the price of that resource respectively. §SMonthly§! automatic trade deals can also be set up in the section to the right."
 TUTORIAL_GOVERNMENTVIEW_SLAVE_MARKET_TITLE:0 "The Slave Market"
 TUTORIAL_GOVERNMENTVIEW_SLAVE_MARKET_DESC:1 "It is often said that life is cheap, but only by those who don't have to pay interplanetary shipping rates and import taxes.\n\nThe §SSlave Market§! allows us to buy and sell §SPops§!, they will be automatically delivered to the selected planet."

Rich Trade Routes may attract §SPirates§!, though they can be countered by Fleets on §SPatrol§!, and by §SDefense Modules§! on §SStarbases§!. §SHangar Modules§! are particularly effective for this."

Once built, they can view and upgrade their facilities here as well. As we know, large Corporations wish only the best for their customers, events of the 23rd cycle notwithstanding."
 TUTORIAL_GOVERNMENTVIEW_POLICIES_TITLE:0 "Policies"
 TUTORIAL_GOVERNMENTVIEW_POLICIES_DESC:0 "The §SPolicies§! tab covers government §SPolicies§!, which have wide-ranging effects on how our empire is run.\n\nThere are often a few possible stances to take for any given §SPolicy§!, though we may be limited by technology as well as our §SEthos§!." #
 TRADE_VIEW_DESC:0 "As our empire grows, §STrade§! between our planets will become an increasingly large part of our economy. §SStarbases§! with §STrade Hubs§! collect §STrade Value§! within their system to be routed to the §SCapital§! for conversion to §SEnergy Credits§!.\n\nMore §STrade Hubs§! means a §SStarbase§! can collect §STrade Value§! from adjacent systems as well.
