 ### Anomaly Events

 DEAL_WITH_FLORA:0 "Plant Aggression"
 DEAL_WITH_FLORA_DESC:0 "The planet's flora is remarkably dexterous, alarmingly aggressive, and definitely worthy of closer study."

 OLD_GODS_BENEFACTRESS_PROJECT:0 "Old Gods: The Benefactress"
 OLD_GODS_BENEFACTRESS_PROJECT_DESC:1 "Every surface of the Benefactress' shrine is covered with a complex web of pictograms, seemingly telling a story far more expansive than the molecular fables that survived through the ages on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName].\n\nThough only distantly related to known ancient [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] languages, current technology should allow us to decipher the pictograms given enough time and resources."
 OLD_GODS_UNDAUNTED_PROJECT:0 "Old Gods: The Undaunted"
 OLD_GODS_UNDAUNTED_PROJECT_DESC:1 "The temple holding the Undaunted's shrine is, true to the myths surrounding him, filled with contraptions of indeterminate origin and purpose. A far cry from the simple puzzle-boxes and tests of strength that once filled his temples on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName], here his holy texts will truly only be read by the worthy.\n\nThat said, our sophisticated analysis tools should make short work of these conundrums."
 OLD_GODS_PERCIPIENT_PROJECT:0 "Old Gods: The Percipient"
 OLD_GODS_PERCIPIENT_PROJECT_DESC:1 "The walls of the space housing the shrine to the Percipient are coated with thick layers of mineral-based lacquer, but the shrine itself is bare.\n\nThe tales of the Percipient are told only to those perceptive enough to understand their meaning - it is just a matter of figuring out what needs to be perceived."

 LIMBO_1_PROJECT:0 "In Limbo"
 LIMBO_1_PROJECT_DESC:0 "An alien vault filled with data storage devices practically begs for some archaeological data recovery."

 PROJECTING_MOON_PROJECT:0 "Projecting"
 PROJECTING_MOON_PROJECT_DESC:0 "An unusual planet has an unusual moon; the usual scanning techniques do not give satisfactory results, and a more hands-on approach is needed."

 GRIMACING_PLANET_PROJECT:0 "Grimacing Planet"
 GRIMACING_PLANET_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The violently animated face of this planet can be stabilized into something potentially habitable, if we act soon."

 OLFACTORY_PROJECT:0 "Olfactory Study"
 OLFACTORY_PROJECT_DESC:0 "An alien artifact is suspected of relaying information through aerosolized aromatic compounds."

 ULTIMATE_WEAPON_PROJECT:0 "The Ultimate Weapon"
 ULTIMATE_WEAPON_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A cache of weapons lie hidden somewhere on the planet. If we can find them, they may provide new martial technologies for our Empire."

 REFINE_ROCK_PROJECT:0 "Positron Bombardment"
 REFINE_ROCK_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Controlled dispersal of positrons from orbit may change the minerals native to the planet into a more useful form."

 CRYSTAL_CODEX_PROJECT:0 "Crystal Codex"
 CRYSTAL_CODEX_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A mineral formation houses hologram-encoded information. Its structure is familiar, but the sheer data density makes it a challenge to decode."

 ALIEN_BARRACKS_PROJECT:0 "Alien Barracks"
 ALIEN_BARRACKS_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A closer xeno-socio-archaeological study of these ruins may provide insights into some past alien war machine."

 ROBOT_MINERALS_PROJECT:0 "Reclaimed by Nature"
 ROBOT_MINERALS_PROJECT_DESC:0 "An overgrown facility may house important secrets."

 BALANCE_ECOSYSTEM_PROJECT:0 "Balance Ecosystem"
 BALANCE_ECOSYSTEM_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A plan has been formulated to attempt to balance the planet's lopsided biosphere using only the tools available to a standard Science Ship.\n\nThere may be unforeseen consequences."

 HEAD_IN_SAND_PROJECT:0 "Head in the Sand"
 HEAD_IN_SAND_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A military fleet can attempt to salvage an ever-burrowing ship."

 THE_PRINCE_PROJECT:0 "The Prince"
 THE_PRINCE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A databank found floating in space houses nothing but a lengthy piece of text, written in a strange, yet familiar, alien language."

 EMERGENCY_BUOY_PROJECT:0 "Emergency Buoy"
 EMERGENCY_BUOY_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A heavily-damaged object seems to act as a repeater for a comms signal."

 WRECKED_FLEET_1:0 "Monumental Transmission"
 WRECKED_FLEET_1_DESC:0 "Decode the message emanating from the monolith."

 WRECKED_FLEET_2:0 "Ancient Alliance Armada"
 WRECKED_FLEET_2_DESC:0 "Deploy engineering teams to restore the salvageable vessels to working order."

 MANUFACTORY_PROJECT:0 "Mining Restoration"
 MANUFACTORY_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Deploy engineering teams to restore an ancient orbital station to working order."

### Colony Events

 HELPFUL_DRONES_1_PROJECT:0 "Left Behind"
 HELPFUL_DRONES_1_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Strange readings are coming from the planet's moon. It could be nothing.\n\nBut it could be something. With a ship in orbit acting as a relay, the colony's scientists will carefully scan the moon's surface in order to get to the heart of the matter."
 POLLEN_1_PROJECT:0 "Floral Study"
 POLLEN_1_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Some of the planet's native flora exhibit several potentially interesting properties."
 POLLEN_2_PROJECT:0 "Labor Study"
 POLLEN_2_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Several recent studies from reputable [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] seats of learning present a number of alternative ways of arranging a vast workforce. An exhaustive meta-study of these new ideas could provide the answer to the problem of declining productivity in challenging colony environments."
 POLLEN_3_PROJECT:0 "A Sense of Impending Doom"
 POLLEN_3_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The situation on the pollen-infested planet has taken a turn for the potentially dangerous. A speedy assessment of the colony's unique situation and especially its increasingly volatile environmental factors is of the utmost importance.\n\nOnce all threats are known, an action plan can be drafted and executed within hours."

### Starting Events

# Wanderlust
 ROGUE_SCIENTIST_1_PROJECT:0 "Wanderlust: What Was Left Behind"
 ROGUE_SCIENTIST_1_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The Chairperson's unseen departure from this system resulted in a perplexing mass of residual energy signatures being cast upon the solar winds.\n\nHopefully a complete analysis of these energies should point us to the Chairperson's next destination, and if need be, make them easier to track in the future."

# Mass Extinction
 MASSEX_1_PROJECT:0 "Analysis: Broken"
 MASSEX_1_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Reconstruct the traumatic past of this celestial body."
 MASSEX_2_PROJECT:0 "Analysis: Burned"
