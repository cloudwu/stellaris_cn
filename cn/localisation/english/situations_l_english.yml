 situation.5.name: "The Mysterious Labyrinth"
# situation.5.desc: "Our colonists on [This.GetName] have made a startling discovery: deep in a remote mountain range, they stumbled across a mysterious structure that, according to our scans, was not there when we first surveyed the [This.GetPlanetMoon]. Although it appears to be in excellent - almost brand new - condition, there is no evidence of [Owner.GetAdj] involvement in its construction. In fact, its architecture shows alien characteristics, with curves and angles that appear unusual and even disturbing to our sense of aesthetic.\n\nAt its entrance, there is a sign (in our language, curiously) with the words "Welcome to the Magnificent Labyrinth of Exotic Trans-Dimensional Anomalies. Enter at your own risk.""
 situation.5.A: "Send a team to investigate."
 situation.5.A.tooltip: "This Approach will cost £energy£ §R5§! §YEnergy§! a month."

 situation.10.name: "Surprising Movements"
# situation.10.desc: "It appears that the alien labyrinth on [Target.GetName] is attempting to attract our attention. Our [Owner.GetResearchers] are loath to ascribe such agency to a building, but that is the only way to put it: it is now no longer situated in a remote mountain pass, but is now instead located a short distance from one of our main settlements. Exactly how it changed position is unclear - from one day to the next, it had simply shifted location. Similarly, the warning signs at the entrance have disappeared, and it now looks... inviting.\n\nWhile some are curious to enter, our [Owner.GetResearchers] urge caution. What is clear, however, is that we can no longer content ourselves with observing the labyrinth - a new approach will be necessary."
# situation.10.desc.gestalt: "It appears that the alien labyrinth on [Target.GetName] is attempting to attract our attention. While it seems surprising that a building would possess a sophisticated consciousness, that is the only way to put it: it is now no longer situated in a remote mountain pass, but is now instead located a short distance from one of our main drone storage areas. Exactly how it changed position is unclear - from one day to the next, it had simply shifted location. Similarly, the warning signs at the entrance have disappeared, and it now looks... inviting.\n\nThis change will make it harder to prevent any drones from stumbling into it, unless we make an effort to cordon off the area."
 situation.10.A: "Cordon off the area - none may enter!"

 situation.20.name: "A Reward for Obstinance"
# situation.20.desc: "The labyrinth is gone.  From one day to the next, it simply was not there anymore. On its site, a message was left for us: "Although it was our intention to study the Beings of your Dimension within our facility, your obstinance in refusing to enter despite all the temptations offered has been an education of its own. We are left enriched by the experience - it will prove most useful to our... endeavors. As a token of our goodwill, we leave you a minor space-time anomaly at the site of our laboratory. We hope it will prove... diverting, to you.""
 situation.25.name: "Labyrinth Destroyed"
# situation.25.desc: "Despite its unusual properties, the labyrinth proved no match for our heavy weaponry. Where it lay, only rubble remains.\n\nUnfortunately, we have not managed to glean much from the remains, but some of the exotic elements used in its construction are salvageable."
 situation.30.name: "Labyrinth Disappeared"
# situation.30.desc: "The labyrinth is gone. From one day to the next, it simply was not there anymore. Nothing remains on the site where it once stood, leaving our [Owner.GetResearchers] baffled as to what it was all about. But perhaps we are safer not knowing."
 situation.30.A: "A threat is lifted from us."
 situation.40.name: "Expedition Report"
# situation.40.desc: "Our communication link to the [Owner.GetResearchers] we sent into the labyrinth was cut off almost as soon as they entered. Nothing was heard for several days afterward as we waited with bated breath. As time passed, hope faded, and we resigned ourselves to the loss of our people.\n\nThen, once all hope was lost, they reemerged! However, this has only raised further questions: they claim to have no memory of their stay within the labyrinth, and their instruments recording their expedition seem to have been garbled. Furthermore, even though they were in the labyrinth for a matter of weeks, they seem to have aged several years!"
 situation.45.name: "Continued Perplexity"
# situation.45.desc: "Further expeditions into the labyrinth have yielded varying, at times unnerving results. On one occasion, our [Owner.GetResearchers] were in for mere seconds, but could give no answer as to why they turned back so fast. On another, they were gone for weeks, but came back seemingly younger than they had left, and with year-long gaps in their memories. Some groups came back in a better physical state than they had left; others bore fresh scars of serious injuries.\n\nOver time, the sign at the entrance has changed, too. "Enter at your own risk" became "Danger of death," and finally "Do not enter the labyrinth. If you do, the planet will explode." In a macabre touch, [Owner.GetAdj] [Owner.Species.GetRemnantNamePlural] adorn the walls - though quite where they came from is not apparent, since there have been no recent unexplained disappearances.\n\nIt is not clear what further study will bring - as our [Owner.GetResearchers] point out, we have no way to confirm or deny the warning stated on the sign. It is, however, becoming ever harder to find volunteers to enter the labyrinth."
 situation.50.name: "A Departure"
# situation.50.desc: "Contrary to its warnings, the labyrinth's disappearance did not destroy [Target.GetName]. Instead, its departure was quite unremarkable - from one day to the next, it was simply gone. A message was left behind: "We thank you for so kindly allowing us to study the Beings of your Dimension. It has proven most useful to our... endeavors. Fortunately, you proved sufficiently... fascinating to the Ministry of Extradimensional Security for them to provide us funding for a smooth exit. As a token of our goodwill, we leave you a minor space-time anomaly at the site of our laboratory. We hope it will prove... diverting.""
 situation.50.A: "We shall delve into its secrets."
 situation.55.name: "A Turbulent Departure"
# situation.55.desc: "Contrary to its warnings, the labyrinth's disappearance did not destroy [Target.GetName]. However, it certainly left its mark: earthquakes ravaged the land, and volcanoes, long-dormant, erupted into life.\n\nAmidst the widespread destruction, a message was left behind: "We thank you for so kindly allowing us to study the Beings of your Dimension. It has proven most useful to our... endeavors. We apologize for the inconvenience our departure causes - we were not able to secure the funding from the Ministry of Extradimensional Security necessary for a smooth withdrawal. As a token of our goodwill, we leave you a minor space-time anomaly at the site of our laboratory. We hope it will prove... diverting.""

 situation.150.desc:0 "Our colonists on [Root.GetName] report a strange phenomenon: snow has begun gathering outside of one of their main colonial settlements.\n\nWell, "snow" is the term they have used to describe it, anyway. It would seem implausible that it is real snow, given that [Root.GetName] is a desert planet where temperatures are seldom below freezing, even in the polar regions. Besides, there were no sightings of it actually falling from the sky. Nevertheless, initial readings suggest that the substance does indeed consist mainly of frozen water - though quite why it's not melting is unclear. Our [Root.Owner.GetResearchers] are eager to investigate its properties, but others caution that it may be dangerous and want it removed."
 situation.155.name:0 "Spreading Chills"
 situation.155.desc:1 "The snow on [Target.GetName] has been multiplying. The initial small patch has swelled to cover an ever-expanding area of the desert, to the point that it is interfering with our transport and cultivation networks. If it does not stop growing soon, there are growing concerns that the colony will be unable to continue to support itself.\n\nOur [Owner.GetResearchers] on the planet have sought, in vain, to explain the phenomenon. When removed from the main body, the snow quickly melts, leaving behind only some organic matter. Our [Owner.GetResearchers] theorize that this residue is causing the snow to maintain its integrity, sheltering it from heat via an unknown chemical reaction. However, they caution that this is only their best guess, and they have managed to find out very little about the strange compound."

 situation.160.name:0 "Removal Problems"
 situation.160.desc:0 "The snow, it appears, is resistant to being removed. While we are able to remove small parts of it from the main body and melt it in that manner, this has done little to halt its onward march, and more invasive attempts to destroy it have so far failed - a spate of mysterious mechanical failures has surrounded the entire effort.\n\nWhat is worse, there have been increasing reports of colonists disappearing in areas affected by the snow. It seems likely that they are connected and the snow is alive - and malicious."

 situation.165.desc:1 "The snow on [Target.GetName] is spreading at a quite alarming rate, and now covers a not-insignificant portion of the planet's equatorial areas. Our military leaders warn that drastic action is needed immediately if we are to halt its advance. However, more level heads point out that it has been a nuisance rather than a menace so far, and it has avoided directly occupying inhabited areas. They posit that it is clearly alive, and argue that we should seek to open dialog with it.\n\nEither way, our room for maneuver is rapidly shrinking."

It appears that several of our colonists have gone missing, having set off to engage in a "snowball fight." Contact was lost with them several days ago, but we have been unable to find any trace of them - living or dead.

# situation.175.desc: "The spread of the snow on [Target.GetName] has not just been a source of novelty - and difficulty - for our colonists. It has also caused rapid changes to the ecosystem, with various native species of flora and fauna put under enormous strain. Already, there have been massive migrations away from the affected areas. However, to our surprise, certain other species have thrived in the new, colder conditions. Our climatologists eagerly observe the developments, calling it a "once in a lifetime" opportunity to watch rapid non-[Owner.GetAdj] controlled climate change in action."
