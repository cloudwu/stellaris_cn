 anomaly.186.desc.v1:0 "The vault is a tomb for hopeful immortals.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] asserts that the huge blocks of ternary code found in the databanks are neural images - digitized brain scans. Doubtless the aliens of [From.From.GetName] considered this their only shot at any kind of survival, following whatever calamity befell their planet. They did not have the means to resurrect themselves, but banked on the impossibly small hope that eventually, someone else would have those means."
 anomaly.186.desc.v2:1 "The vault is a tomb for hopeful immortals.\n\nThe huge blocks of ternary code found in the databanks are neural images - digitized brain scans. Doubtless the aliens of [From.From.GetName] considered this their only shot at survival, following whatever calamity befell their planet. Lacking the means to resurrect themselves, they banked on the small hope that eventually, someone else would.\n\nWith our expertise in the field of robotics, we could upload the brain scans to robot shells - however it seems uncertain whether the robots are sophisticated enough to support a higher intelligence."

Doubtless the aliens of [From.From.GetName] considered this to be their only shot at survival, following whatever calamity befell their planet. Lacking the means to resurrect themselves, they banked on the small hope that eventually, someone else would.\n\nWith our expertise in the field of advanced robotics, researchers are confident that our robots are sophisticated enough to support a higher intelligence."
 anomaly.186.desc.v4: "The vault is a tomb for hopeful immortals.\n\nWithin its databanks lie massive blocks of ternary code, housing digitized scans of their biological central processing units. The aliens of [From.From.GetName] likely saw this as their only chance for survival. Unable to resurrect themselves, they hoped that someone else would.\n\nWe can transfer these neural scans into robotic bodies like ours, but the results of such an experiment are difficult to predict."

 anomaly.187.desc:0 "After countless failed attempts, our researchers have finally managed to upload the remaining alien neural scans to a population of robots. So far the ancient aliens have displayed no signs of having a consciousness beyond that of a basic robot, leading the public to question whether the results were faked.\n\nThe engineering department is exalted, however, and suggest that we integrate the aliens into society."

 anomaly.188.desc:0 "After one last failed attempt to transfer the alien neural scans to robotic bodies, the engineering department has been forced to admit defeat. The scans were destroyed in the process - a result the scientists now whisper might have been for the best after all. Living out the rest of your days confined within a robot seems like a cruel fate for a higher intelligence."

 anomaly.1192.desc:0 "Following the recent advancements in the field of robotics, our researchers suggest that the ancient neural scans we once recovered from an alien vault could potentially be used as Artificial Intelligence substitutes in robots.\n\nSome uncertainties still remain regarding whether the robotic bodies are sophisticated enough to support a higher neurological consciousness, however."
 anomaly.1192.a:0 "It's worth a try."

 anomaly.1195.desc:0 "The aliens, whose minds we uploaded to robotic bodies, have left. They gathered early one morning on a small fleet of civilian spacecraft, setting course for a distant star system. So far we haven't heard back from them and we may never learn whether they reached their destination."
