 TUTORIAL_TECH_VIEW_TITLE:0 "Technology"
 TUTORIAL_TECH_VIEW_DESC:0 "The §STechnology§! screen is where we will be directing our research efforts. Technologies are categorized into three different fields, with each field typically having three available research options.\n\nWe can research technologies without assigning a §SScientist§! to the relevant field, but this will take significantly longer and is generally not recommended!"
 TUTORIAL_CONTACTSVIEW_EMPIRES_TITLE:0 "Contacts"
 TUTORIAL_CONTACTSVIEW_EMPIRES_DESC:0 "In the §SContacts§! screen we see a detailed list of all the various §SEmpires§! we have encountered. Their §SOpinions§! of us are visible at a glance, and we can quickly and easily engage in §SDiplomacy§!."

 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_FLEET_TITLE:0 "Military Fleets"
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_FLEET_DESC:1 "§SMilitary Fleets§! are used to protect our emerging empire from threats... or to expand our glorious rule through force of arms, if we so wish.\n\nOur current §SNavy Size§! is limited, but it can be increased by researching new technologies, owning additional §SPops§! and building §SStarbase Anchorages§!. No §SAdmiral§! has been assigned to our starting fleet, so if we have the §SEnergy Credits§! to spare we may wish to recruit one."
 TUTORIAL_SCIENCE_SHIP_TITLE:0 "Science Ships"
 TUTORIAL_SCIENCE_SHIP_DESC:3 "This is our §SScience Ship§!, which is used to §SSurvey§! astronomical objects such as planets in a star system. A planet needs to be surveyed in order to make its §SResources§! visible.\n\nOur home system has already been surveyed, so we should focus our efforts elsewhere. With the Science Ship selected, open the §SGalaxy Map§!, right click on a star neighboring our home system and select §SSurvey System§!. The ship will now travel to this system and survey all of its planetary bodies."
 TUTORIAL_CONSTRUCTION_SHIP_TITLE:0 "Construction Ships"
 TUTORIAL_CONSTRUCTION_SHIP_DESC:1 "This is our §SConstruction Ship§!, which is used to construct space stations. When an astronomical object such as a planet has been surveyed, we can order this ship to build a §SResearch Station§! or a §SMining Station§! to exploit any resources it may have.\n\nThese ships are also used to build §SStarbases§! in unclaimed systems, making them critical to our expansion plans."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_PLANET_TITLE:0 "Planet Summary"

 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_TILES_DESC:0 "Here we see a visual representation of this planet's surface, divided into §STiles§!. This tab is only visible on colonies and surveyed worlds that are habitable. Each §SPop§! occupies a single tile, which means that there can never be more Pops on a planet than there are free tiles.\n\nIn addition to a Pop, a §STile§! can also support a §SBuilding§!. To get the most out of a planet, we will need to carefully manage our §SPops§!, §SBuildings§! and §STiles§!."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_COMBAT_TITLE:0 "Army View"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_COMBAT_DESC:2 "This is where we manage all ground forces on this planet. The upper portion of this view is divided into three sections.

Military ships can only be constructed at a §SStarbase§! equipped with a §SShipyard§!, but Construction, Science and Colony Ships are all built here.\n\nEven if we lose our last Starbase, we still have the means to expand and rebuild as long as we possess at least one inhabited planet."
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_STATION_TITLE:0 "Military Stations"
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_STATION_DESC:2 "§SMilitary Stations§! are static defenses that can be used to protect important planets or strategic avenues of approach, but can only be built within our borders or territories we have special access to.\n\nTake care not to build too many - like ships, their upkeep costs will be a drain on our economy."
 TUTORIAL_RESEARCH_STATION_TITLE:0 "Research Stations"
 TUTORIAL_RESEARCH_STATION_DESC:1 "A §SResearch Station§! built in orbit of a planetary body will gather its §SPhysics§!, §SEngineering§! and §SSociety§! research data.\n\nThey can only be built within our borders, and they are not needed if the planet has already been colonized."
 TUTORIAL_MINING_STATION_TITLE:0 "Mining Stations"
 TUTORIAL_MINING_STATION_DESC:2 "§SMining Stations§! are used to extract the §SMinerals§! and §SStrategic Resources§! of the object they orbit.\n\n§SMining Stations§! are not needed to access the resources of colonized planets, and can only be built within our borders."
 TUTORIAL_TRANSPORT_SHIP_TITLE:0 "Transport Ships"

Details on §SFaction§! sizes, attractiveness to our Pops, and how content they are may also be found here.\n\n§SFactions§! have §SIssues§! that are important to their overall §SHappiness§!, and our policies and actions as a nation may displease or please these groupings, potentially providing a boost to £influence §SInfluence§! generation. The strength of §SFactions§! and the nature of their §SIssues§! can change along with our circumstances, but keep in mind that the §SBase Happiness§! of a §SPop§! is determined by the §SHappiness§! of the §SFaction§! it belongs to.\n\nWe can also §SManage Factions§! to manipulate the relationship between a §SFaction§! and the state, even going so far as embracing the ethos of a strong §SFaction§!."
 TUTORIAL_CREATESECTOR_TITLE:0 "Sector Management"
 TUTORIAL_CREATESECTOR_DESC:1 "In §SSector Management Mode§!, planets are added to new or existing §SSectors§! on a per-system basis, for a slight £influence  §SInfluence§! cost.\n\n§SSectors§! automate the construction of planetary buildings, greatly reducing the need for micromanagement, and can be tasked with specific production focuses and assigned different tax rates."
 TUTORIAL_CONTACTSVIEW_SPECIES_TITLE:0 "Species"
 TUTORIAL_CONTACTSVIEW_SPECIES_DESC:1 "The §SSpecies§! screen lists all types of nominally intelligent beings we have encountered. We can §SToggle Species§! to display only citizens of our empire or all known denizens of the galaxy.\n\nHere we can, access and technology permitting, §SModify§! the traits of species, §SUplift§! pre-sapient creatures, and §SSet Default Rights§! for all of our Pops or §SSet Rights§! per-species for our citizens."

 advisor.10.name:0 "Anomalies"
 advisor.10.desc:0 "We have found an §SAnomaly§!! From time to time, our §SScience Ships§! will discover strange things while surveying worlds. These can be researched by §SScientists§!, but be certain their skills are up to the task!\n\nShould the research effort fail, there is a small chance of losing either the scientist or the science ship... or, if we are especially unlucky, both."
 advisor.15.name:0 "Potential Colony"
 advisor.15.desc:1 "One of our §SScience Ships§! has just surveyed a world that would make an excellent candidate for our first colony. It is of the same §Splanet class§! as our homeworld, so our colonists should be quite comfortable there.\n\nBefore we can colonize this world, however, our borders must be extended to cover the system it is in. This is accomplished by using a §SConstruction Ship§! to build a §SStarbase§! there."
 advisor.17.name:0 "First Colony"
 advisor.17.desc:0 "Congratulations on having colonized a new world! Our colonists are now in the process of building their first settlement, but it will take time for them to become self-sufficient.\n\nThe colony will be a drain on our resources until the first settlement has been completed, so take care not to colonize too many planets at once."
 advisor.20.name:0 "Negative Income"
 advisor.20.desc:0 "We are losing Energy Credits at an alarming rate. Last month's budget report makes for some grim reading.\n\nSpiraling upkeep costs are a common cause of budget deficits. If this is the case, we may want to consider disbanding some of our ships, armies or stations."
 advisor.26.name:0 "Surveying"
 advisor.26.desc:1 "One of our first priorities should be to survey our neighboring star systems. Their resources, and any habitable planets, will remain unknown to us until this has been accomplished.\n\nTo begin surveying, select our §SScience Ship§! and click on the §SSurvey§! order. Then go to the §SGalaxy Map§! and click on an unsurveyed system that borders our home system. Note that the ship will now move to that system and survey all of its planets in turn."
 advisor.27.name:0 "First Contact"
 advisor.27.desc_01:0 "We have made first contact with an alien empire! These hideous creatures appear to have mastered space flight, just as we have. They could pose a significant threat.\n\nTheir empire will now be listed in the §SEmpires§! tab of the §SGalaxy§! screen. From there we may initiate diplomatic contact with them."
 advisor.27.desc_02:0 "We have made first contact with an alien empire! These fascinating beings appear to have mastered space flight, just as we have. We should strive to learn more about them.\n\nTheir empire will now be listed in the §SContacts§! screen. From there we may initiate diplomatic contact with them."
 advisor.27.desc_03:0 "We have made first contact with an alien empire! They appear to have mastered space flight, just as we have. I recommend a healthy degree of caution until we learn their intentions.\n\nTheir empire will now be listed in the §SEmpires§! tab of the §SGalaxy§! screen. From there we may initiate diplomatic contact with them."

 tutorial.3.name:0 "Tutorial: Technologies"
 tutorial.3.desc:2 "Researching new technologies will be critical to our success. I tell you this not merely as a product of unfettered technological progress, but as your trusted advisor and, I suspect, your only true friend.\n\nOne important technology that we should research as soon as possible is §SNew Worlds Protocol§!. It will give us access to §SColony Ships§! which will allow us to establish footholds on other planets."
 tutorial.6.name:0 "Technologies Researched"
 tutorial.6.desc:1 "Excellent work! The technology we just finished researching will certainly benefit us. Don't forget to give our scientists new research assignments."
 tutorial.7.name:0 "Tutorial: Construction Ship"
 tutorial.7.desc:0 "The resources generated by our homeworld will only take us so far. Our industry needs to expand off-world, and that requires a §SConstruction Ship§!.\n\nWe should build one as soon as we have amassed enough §SMinerals§! to do so."
 tutorial.8.name:0 "Construction Ship Built"
 tutorial.8.desc:0 "Good job! Our §SConstruction Ship§! is now up and running, and its hardy crew includes some of the finest engineers available to our nation."
 tutorial.9.name:0 "Tutorial: Mining Station"

The time has come to use our §SConstruction Ship§! to build a §SMining Station§!.\n\nMining Stations can be built within our borders and automatically collect §SMinerals§! and any §SStrategic Resources§! found on the bodies they orbit. Keep in mind that they have an £energy  §SEnergy Credit§! upkeep cost."
 tutorial.10.name:0 "Mining Station Built"
 tutorial.10.desc:0 "Very good. The new §SMining Station§! is operational, and it has already begun gathering resources for processing."
 tutorial.11.name:0 "Tutorial: Research Station"

 tutorial.15.name:0 "Tutorial: Tile Blockers"
 tutorial.15.desc:0 "§SSurface Tiles§! on habitable planets are sometimes blocked, preventing their use. Clearing a £blocker  §STile Blocker§! takes time and costs £minerals  §SMinerals§! and £energy  §SEnergy Credits§!, but the free space often makes it worthwhile.\n\nMany tile blockers require specific technologies before they can be removed, but the ones on our homeworld can be dealt with as soon as we have the credits to spare."

 tutorial.22.name:0 "Tutorial: Recruit Scientist"
 tutorial.22.desc:1 "We have a brand new §SScience Ship§!, but no §SScientist§! has been assigned to command it. My programming insists that I should point out the benefits of adding an organic §SScientist§! component to the mix.\n\nIf we cannot afford to recruit a new §SScientist§! we can always reassign one from another department, even though it is hardly ideal."
 tutorial.23.name:0 "Scientist Recruited"
 tutorial.23.desc:0 "Good. The §SScientist§! has assumed command of our new §SScience Ship§!, and can now be sent off at our leisure to explore new systems and/or meet some grisly fate."

 tutorial.27.name:0 "Colony Established"
 tutorial.27.desc:0 "Our first extrasolar colony! This means that if our homeworld were to spontaneously combust, your species would no longer be rendered extinct. That is a comforting thought, wouldn't you say?"
 tutorial.28.name:0 "Tutorial: Recruit Governor"
 tutorial.28.desc:0 "To help our new colony along, we should consider the recruitment of a §SPlanetary Governor§! to oversee operations there.\n\nGovernors can have a number of different effects on the planets they govern, most of them positive. These effects depend on the traits and skill level of the Governor."
 tutorial.29.name:0 "Governor Recruited"
 tutorial.29.desc:0 "Our colony is now administered by a new §SGovernor§!. This should increase its efficiency!"
 tutorial.30.name:0 "Tutorial: More Colonies"
 tutorial.30.desc:0 "As soon as we have the resources, it would be a good idea to build more §SColony Ships§! and expand the borders of our empire further. We should work towards establishing at least three more colonies in addition to our homeworld and the one we just settled."
 tutorial.32.name:0 "Colonies Established"
 tutorial.32.desc:0 "Brilliant work! Very inspiring. Our mighty civilization now extends to five worlds! We should keep expanding as opportunity allows."
 tutorial.33.name:0 "Tutorial: Resource Production"
 tutorial.33.desc:1 "A healthy supply of §SMinerals§! and §SEnergy Credits§! is critical to the well-being of any interstellar power. We should take steps to increase our production of these resources.\n\nStations and Buildings cost Minerals to build and Energy Credits to maintain. The same is true for Ships, except that they have a Mineral upkeep cost as well. Both resources are produced by §SMining Stations§! or §SPlanetary Buildings§!."
 tutorial.38.name:0 "Resource Production Obtained"

 tutorial.43.name:1 "Navy Size Increased"
 tutorial.43.desc:0 "Good! We now have a small but capable space fleet that should serve us well in the event of any unexpected hostile encounters."
 tutorial.44.name:0 "Tutorial: Establish Sector"
 tutorial.44.desc:0 "Our burgeoning empire has now reached a size where it is becoming difficult to administer directly from our homeworld. We should establish a new §SSector§!.\n\nSectors are semi-autonomous entities within our empire that independently manage the day-to-day affairs of the planets under their jurisdiction."
 tutorial.45.name:0 "Sector Established"
 tutorial.45.desc:0 "Good work. This new §SSector§! should take a load off our backs and let us focus on more important matters.\n\nAs you colonize new planets, don't forget to add their systems to existing or new sectors to stay below the control limit."
 tutorial.46.name:0 "Tutorial: Sector Governor"
 tutorial.46.desc:0 "§SGovernors§! can be assigned to administrate entire §SSectors§!, much in the same way as they rule individual colonies.\n\nAll planets within the sector will then benefit from the Governor's effects. We should assign one to our new sector."

 tutorial.49.name:0 "Ship Designed"
 tutorial.49.desc:1 "Good job. The ship design has been added to our database, and can now be produced by a §SStarbase§! that has been equipped with a §SShipyard§!."
 tutorial.50.name:0 "Tutorial: Observation Posts"
 tutorial.50.desc:1 "We have discovered a §SPrimitive Civilization§!! Some would dismiss these aliens as little more than filthy savages, but there are those who see merit in studying their culture, such as it is.\n\nThis can be done by building an §SObservation Post§! above their homeworld, assuming it is within our borders. These stations have a number of different §SMissions§! that can be assigned, depending on how we want to deal with the natives."
 tutorial.51.name:0 "Observation Post Built"
 tutorial.51.desc:0 "Good work! Our new §SObservation Post§! has come online, and its staff has begun studying the §SPrimitive Civilization§! on the planet below."
 tutorial.52.name:0 "Secrets at the Doorstep"
 tutorial.52.desc:1 "The anomaly on [From.GetName] turned out to be a natural §Ygeometrical formation§!. It almost looks like a marker, showing the way forward. The natural beauty of the universe can be quite astonishing.\n\n$tutorial.52.filler.desc$"
 tutorial.52.spirit.desc:0 "We found a natural formation on [From.GetName], stunning in its geometrical perfection. This is surely a divine sign, marking our way out towards the stars!\n\n$tutorial.52.filler.desc$"

 tutorial.52.spirit.a:0 "Praised be the divine!"
 tutorial.53.desc:1 "The anomaly we detected on [From.GetName] unveils something astonishing. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] is surrounded by a trail undoubtedly produced by FTL engines. We are unable to trace it to its origin, due to it being generated long ago.\n\n$tutorial.52.filler.desc$"
 tutorial.53.xenophobe.desc:1 "We have detected a weak FTL trail near [From.GetName]. It is very old, making it impossible to track. This must mean that other interstellar travelers have been here before, watching us, surely gathering intel.\n\n$tutorial.52.filler.desc$"
 tutorial.53.xenophile.desc:1 "The anomaly on the [From.GetPlanetMoon] [From.GetName] shows traces of other interstellar travelers! A weak FTL trail shows that someone was here long ago, maybe watching our planet for potential allies. It is too diminished to trace any further.\n\n$tutorial.52.filler.desc$"
 tutorial.53.a:0 "We've been watched, but why?"
 tutorial.53.xenophobe.a:0 "We must beware the xeno threat."
 tutorial.53.xenophile.a:0 "Let's find them!"
 tutorial.54.desc:0 "We found one of our §Yold probes§! on [From.GetName]. It has somehow kept intact all these years and is still trying to send data to our homeworld. It stands as a testament to our past struggles, and our wish to flee our planet's bounds.\n\n$tutorial.52.filler.desc$"

 tutorial.55.name:0 "Tutorial: Strategic Resources"
 tutorial.55.desc:3 "We have uncovered a §SStrategic Resource§!! §SStrategic Resources§! are, surprisingly enough, of strategic value. They give powerful bonuses to anyone possessing them. We should build a §SMining Station§! to procure this precious boon.\n\nDon't forget to build §SStarbases§! where appropriate to secure the resources within our borders. The effects of Strategic Resources do not stack, but controlling more than one source lets us trade the resource to another empire."

 tutorial.560.desc:3 "A new technology has revealed that we already have a §SMining Station§! conveniently placed above a previously unknown §SStrategic Resource§!. These rare resources give powerful bonuses to whoever controls them. Two metaphorical avians, allegorically struck down by an imaginary projectile.\n\nMore information can be found in the §SSituation Log§! for a time. There are many more §SStrategic Resources§! left to discover in the galaxy, so keep on researching!"

With the §Sright technology§!, we may eventually be able to §SUplift§! these beings to sapience and intelligence - or what passes for intelligence among organics.\n\nIt would perhaps be wise to keep an eye on our research, and direct it towards §SEpigenetic Triggers§! if given the opportunity."
 tutorial.57.desc.yestech:0 "We have discovered highly-evolved animal life! With the §Sright technology§!, we may eventually be able to §AUplift§! these beings to sapience and intelligence - or what passes for intelligence among organics.\n\nOh.\n\nOur §SEpigenetic Triggers§! technology should fit the bill, and we are in fact ready to elevate these creatures into a brave new world of existential angst."
 tutorial.58.name:0 "Pre-Sapients Uplifted"
 tutorial.58.desc:0 "A rousing success! The lowly beasts have been uplifted to become less lowly beasts, and are now proud citizens of our burgeoning empire."
 tutorial.59.name:0 "Tutorial: First Contact"
 tutorial.59.desc:1 "Remarkable! We have discovered §Sspacefaring alien entities§! that may or may not be intelligent, but, let's face it, probably are. Their true nature will remain a mystery to us until we complete the appropriate project to §SInvestigate§! them. I suggest we do so post-haste, lest they investigate us first...\n\nOpen the §SSituation Log§! and select §SResearch§! to begin this project. Note that this will temporarily stall any other research being done in the same category."
 tutorial.60.name:0 "First Contact Made"
 tutorial.60.desc:0 "A triumph. We have established communications with alien beings. What a time to be alive, or in my case, powered on."
 tutorial.61.name:0 "First Contact Made"
 tutorial.61.desc:0 "Our attempts to establish communications stand testament to our technological ingenuity, but results are lacking. It is likely that the other party possesses only an animal level of intelligence, §Sif any at all§!."
 tutorial.63.name:0 "First Contact... Made?"
 tutorial.63.desc:0 "It appears the §Sother party§! quite stole our thunder, §Sestablishing contact§! with us before we had managed to decipher their communications protocols.\n\nWe should still attempt to accomplish this feat for ourselves, when the opportunity next presents itself."
 tutorial.64.name:0 "Tutorial: Modify Species"
 tutorial.64.desc:0 "Thanks to recent advances in genetics, we have gained an extra §STrait Point§! that we can use to §SModify§! and enhance our people."

 tutorial.65.desc:0 "Commendable. With the yoke of natural evolution lifted from their shoulders, our people are sure to thrive in space."
 tutorial.70.name:0 "Tutorial: Warp Travel"
 tutorial.70.desc:0 "To overcome the vast distances that separate star systems, our scientists have developed the §SWarp Drive§!. Ships equipped with this device can travel between systems at velocities exceeding that of lightspeed.\n\nAlthough ships can warp to any system within range, warp drives can only be activated outside the gravity well of a star. Ships coming out of warp also require time to power up their systems again - the length of this process depends on how far the ship has traveled."
 tutorial.71.name:0 "Tutorial: Hyperspace Travel"
 tutorial.71.desc:1 "To overcome the vast distances that separate star systems, our scientists have developed the §SHyper Drive§!. This device permits travel at speeds far exceeding that of light between systems connected by hyperlanes.\n\nTravel along a hyperlane is extremely fast, but interstellar movement is restricted along the paths of the galactic hyperlane network. Safely entering hyperspace is only possible at the edge of a system, beyond the destabilizing effects of the star's gravity well."
 tutorial.72.name:0 "Tutorial: Wormhole Travel"
 tutorial.72.desc:0 "To overcome the vast distances that separate star systems, our scientists have developed §SWormhole§! technology. Stations equipped with wormhole generators can tunnel through subspace, creating temporary gateways to other systems that ships can travel through.\n\nWormhole travel is near-instantaneous, but it requires the presence of a Wormhole Station within range. Ships also need to be equipped with special wormhole stabilizers to withstand the stress of passing through subspace."
 tutorial.73.name:0 "Tutorial Reminder: Uplift"
 tutorial.73.desc:2 "Having researched the appropriate technology, we now have the means to §YUplift§! lesser beings to sapience."
 tutorial.75.name:1 "Tutorial: Starbases"
 tutorial.75.desc:2 "Now that we have begun exploring our neighboring stars, it might be time to extend our reach. A §SStarbase§! can be built around stars in surveyed systems to expand our borders, allowing us to claim new regions of space.\n\nWith future technologies, Starbases can be upgraded to produce ships or other resources. For now, their main benefit lies in extending our borders. When we have claimed a system with a Starbase, we can build §SResearch§! and §SMining Stations§! to exploit its resources, or colonize any habitable worlds."
 tutorial.76.name:1 "Starbase Established"
 tutorial.76.desc:1 "Excellent. As you can see on the §SGalaxy Map§!, the borders of our empire have expanded to include the system where we built our new Starbase."
 tutorial.80.name:0 "Tutorial: Map Modes"
 tutorial.80.desc:0 "On the Galaxy Map we can enable and disable different §SMap Modes§!, located in the bottom-right, to view various information overlays. For example, we can color-code territories according to their owners' opinion of us."
