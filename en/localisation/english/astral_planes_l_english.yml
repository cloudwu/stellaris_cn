 START_SCREEN_RIFTWORLD: "For as long as we can remember, the Great Rift has loomed in the skies above [GetHomeWorldName]. Legends propose that our past is intimately entwined with this mysterious celestial scar and an ancient impact site near our capital.\n\nFor generations, the site was revered, but little understood. However, recent seismic activity has uncovered subsurface anomalies in the crater. Preparations are already underway to drill into its core. Opinions remain divided on what we may uncover there.$START_SCREEN_RIFTWORLD_END$"
 START_SCREEN_RIFTWORLD_MACHINE: "For as long as our databanks reach back, the Great Rift has loomed in the skies above [GetHomeWorldName]. Our internal clocks are synced with the frequency of the celestial scar and our earliest records describe an ancient impact site near our capital.\n\nFor many iterations, the site was left alone, but little understood.

 astral_planes.2125.name: "High Speed Impact"
 astral_planes.2125.desc: "Initial excavations into the base of the crater revealed a fully-formed cylinder of impactite lodged deep into the earth.\n\nThis vein must have originated from a meteoric impact of extremely high velocity. Initial calculations demonstrate the object must have arrived at a mesurable fraction of the speed of light. It's a wonder that it made it to the surface."

 astral_planes.2135.name: "Ancient Sphere"
 astral_planes.2135.desc: "We have recovered the sphere from the underground lake.\n\nWhile covered in vegetative growth, much of it remains fully intact. Its construction is a strange mix of highly sophisticated design and crude assembly. Perfectly smooth metallic plates cover the frontal portion of the ship, which must have reduced friction significantly upon atmospheric entry.\n\nThe trajectory of its resting site aligns with the vein of impactite, confirming that this sphere is the source of the metamorphic rock that led us here. Even more incredibly, there are signs that this vessel had passengers."

Several of these mention names associated with our most sacred legends.\n\nAn intricate network of ladders snakes upward from the impact site to a massive tunnel system. Based on the varying ages of the rope fibers, these caverns must have been occupied for several generations as the crash survivors worked their way toward the surface.\n\nHowever, nothing we'd discovered thus far could have prepared us for the final revelation: one of the upper chambers contained a burial site. DNA analysis conducted on the remains within revealed a shocking truth: these people are our ancestors.\n\nWhere exactly they came from, or why this place was forgotten, is yet unknown. The salvaged documents are in a poorly preserved state, but we have recovered a data log from the sphere. It clearly shows that the vessel arrived in our star system by means of the Astral Rift near [from.planet.GetName]."

These survivors were our predecesors.\n\nWhere exactly they came from, or why this location was lost, is yet unknown.

Our scanners indicate no explosive or volatile compounds contained within. It seems safe to approach and study further."
 astral_planes.6010.name: "The Greatest Show in the Multiverse"
 astral_planes.6010.desc: "The brightly lit object we discovered on this asteroid is an advertisement.\n\nThis massive display is supported by a mechanical infrastructure occupying the inside of the asteroid it is mounted on. The asteroid itself is anomalously suspended at one point in space, unaffected by the gravitational pull of any nearby object.\n\nThe advertisement itself is in reference to what it calls "The Greatest Show in the Multiverse".There is a terminal accepting energy credits for direct transport to the attraction."

This means that at some point in time an Astral Scar was pulled into its singularity and is now slowly being ejected. Such an event was previously thought impossible.\n\nThere may be a way to eject the scar and restabilize this system's space by directing a highly concentrated stream of §Y$astral_threads$§! into the singularity.\n\nHowever, taking no further action would allow us to continue harvesting the cosmic fabric from a safe distance."

These particles have coalesced into an $astral_rift$ that is now suspended within its gravity well.\n\nHow this celestial anomaly was ever sucked into the singularity in the first place remains unknown, but now we can at least investigate what lies on the other side."
