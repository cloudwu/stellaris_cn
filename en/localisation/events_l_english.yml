 # Anomaly Events
 ####################################
 anomaly.1.name:0 "Coprolite Asteroid"
 anomaly.1.desc:0 "Although it is difficult to accept, all indications point towards asteroid [From.GetName] being a coprolite - a piece of fossilized feces from some kind of massive life form. It appears to be almost a billion years old, and much of the fossil's original organic composition has been replaced by mineral deposits. Our scientists are baffled as to what kind of creature could have produced something like this."
 anomaly.5.name:0 "Pirate Treasure"
 anomaly.5.desc:0 "This asteroid appears to have been used intermittently as a base by a band of alien pirates roughly one thousand years ago. A small boarding party entered the base and managed to recover their abandoned treasure hoard. It consisted largely of stolen trinkets and artifacts, but some of it still appears to be of value."
 anomaly.5.a:0 "These ill-gotten gains shall serve the state."
 anomaly.10.name:0 "Asteroid Fauna"
 anomaly.10.desc:0 "Amazingly, while conducting their survey of [From.GetName], the crew of the [Root.GetName] picked up several life signs coming from within the asteroid. There appears to be a colony of large burrowing worm-like lithovores within the rock, which has been riddled with tunnels. These unique life forms have somehow adapted to a life in the coldness of space."
 anomaly.10.a:0 "These creatures should be studied."
 anomaly.15.name:0 "Asteroid Fossils"
 anomaly.15.desc:0 "Fossils from what appears to be several species of aquatic animals have been found on the barren and airless surface of [From.GetName]. There are indications that the surrounding asteroid belt was created from the remains of a shattered planet, and these findings seem to confirm that theory. Judging by the fossils, the planet supported life and was at least partially covered by water."
 anomaly.25.name:0 "Derelict Shipyard"
 anomaly.25.desc:0 "A large portion of asteroid [From.GetName] has been hollowed out to allow for the construction of some kind of shipyard. It has been abandoned and exposed to the vacuum of space for centuries - if anything useful remained, it has already been looted by previous explorers. The design of the shipyard itself is unique, however, and much could potentially be learned by its study."
 anomaly.25.a:0 "We should study its construction."
 anomaly.30.name:0 "Junkyard"
 anomaly.30.desc:0 "This asteroid was evidently used as a junkyard by someone at some point in the distant past. All manner of discarded machinery and metallic refuse has been deposited inside the asteroid's weak gravity well, being slowly pulled into the jumble of debris that now covers the surface. There is nothing of particular value to be found here, but a lot of the metal could be salvaged by a mining station."
 anomaly.30.a:0 "We should recycle what we can."
 anomaly.35.name:0 "Crashed Scout Craft"
 anomaly.35.desc:0 "A small scout craft of some kind plowed into the surface of this asteroid millennia ago, creating a shallow canyon. There is no visible cockpit on the ship, leading our scientists to believe it was either piloted by remote or through some kind of primitive artificial intelligence. Although it is too damaged to be salvaged, the ship hasn't been picked clean by looters yet."
 anomaly.35.a:0 "We will study its design."
 anomaly.40.name:0 "Automated Mining Base"
 anomaly.40.desc:0 "We have detected an automated mining base built in close orbit around asteroid [From.GetName]. There is scorching on the hull indicative of light weapons damage, and the facility appeared to be stuck in some kind of feedback loop. We have managed to reprogram the base systems and the facility is now fully under our control."
 anomaly.40.desc.alt:1 "We have detected an automated mining base built in close orbit around asteroid [From.GetName]. There are large chunks of the hull missing, the jagged holes indicative of heavy weapons damage. The station is beyond repair, but salvaging it will provide us with valuable materials."
 anomaly.50.name:0 "Weapons Target Range"
 anomaly.50.desc:0 "Asteroid [From.GetName] is pockmarked with craters from weapon blasts, and appears to have been used as a target range by someone roughly two millennia ago. Residual energy readings suggest they tested increasingly exotic weaponry, including subspace bombs and some kind of singularity generator. Our scientists would be interested in studying the unusual energy echoes that remain."
 anomaly.55.name:0 "Asteroid Collision"
 anomaly.55.desc:0 "Upon closer examination, we have discovered that a smaller asteroid consisting almost entirely of precious metals recently collided with [From.GetName]. This small but dense cache of metals was hidden just beneath the asteroid's surface, but now that it has been discovered it should be accessible to mining."
 anomaly.55.a:0 "A lucky find!"
 anomaly.60.name:0 "Exotic Radiation"
 anomaly.60.desc:0 "This particular asteroid is an extrasolar capture, and appears to have been washed by some kind of exotic radiation as it plummeted through interstellar space before finally settling in the [From.GetStarName] system. The original source of this radiation remains unknown, but the [Root.GetName] has been able to pick up a wealth of physics data by studying the asteroid's energy emissions."
 anomaly.65.name:0 "Crashed Ore Freighter"
 anomaly.65.desc:0 "After identifying an anomaly in the gravity well of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] has discovered the shattered wreckage of an ancient ore superfreighter buried deep within the asteroid's crust. It must have carried a full load when it crashed, and the asteroid's mineral wealth has been revised accordingly."
 anomaly.300.name:0 "Atmospheric Ecosystem"
 anomaly.300.desc:0 "We have discovered a thriving ecosystem in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant [From.GetName]. Massive floating creatures, having evolved bodies filled with lighter than air gases, follow the wind currents and feed off the energy released by the gas giant's frequent lightning storms. These beings in turn support colonies of smaller animals that prey on atmospheric plankton and each other."
 anomaly.305.name:0 "Abandoned Cargo Pod"
 anomaly.305.desc:0 "A discarded cargo pod was left by someone in the upper atmosphere of [From.GetName] long ago. It has somehow escaped the notice of other spacefarers, and its decaying orbit means it would have been lost in the gas giant's crushing atmosphere within another few years. When the crew of the [Root.GetName] unsealed the pod, they found a stash of alien jewelry made out of precious metals."
 anomaly.310.name:0 "Social Experiment"
 anomaly.310.desc:0 "A small aerostat colony was found floating just above the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to have been self-sufficient, and remains from several different species were found on board.\n\nAs best as we can tell, the colony was some kind of social experiment conducted centuries ago that ultimately ended with the colonists massacring each other. We have downloaded all of the data found in the colony's limited databanks."
 anomaly.315.name:0 "Aerostat Colonies"
 anomaly.315.desc:0 "A ruined network of aerostat colonies dating back at least three millennia can be found in low orbit of this gas giant. Their original function appears to have been gas mining, but they have since been abandoned and reoccupied by many different races and pirate groups.\n\nThe colonies have been thoroughly stripped of anything even remotely valuable, but the mere fact that they are still aloft after all this time makes them an interesting subject of engineering research."
 anomaly.320.name:0 "Debris Field"
 anomaly.320.desc:0 "The strong gravity well of [From.GetName] has pulled in a massive amount of space debris which has formed a dense layer around parts of the gas giant. Most of it appears to be wreckage from a series of space battles fought in the system several millennia ago.\n\nScavengers have already scoured the debris of valuable technologies and artifacts, but a mining station should be able to recycle the metal."
 anomaly.325.name:0 "Crushed Cruiser"
 anomaly.325.desc:0 "The shattered remnants of a cruiser-sized starship can be detected in a decaying orbit deep inside the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to have ventured far into the gas giant's atmosphere, perhaps in a desperate attempt to escape a pursuer, only to be crushed by the atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe vessel is too deep to be salvaged, but a structural scan of the wreckage has provided us with some interesting engineering data."
 anomaly.325.a:0 "A remarkable vessel."
 anomaly.330.name:0 "Extreme Storms"
 anomaly.330.desc:0 "[From.GetName] frequently experiences massive and extremely violent storm systems in its atmosphere. Several dozen persistent storms are visible from orbit, with winds often reaching speeds in excess of 700 m/s. The cause of these storms is not immediately apparent, as we have found nothing in the planet's climate model that would explain them. Our scientists are interested in studying this anomaly."
 anomaly.335.name:0 "Energy Signature"
 anomaly.335.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] has picked up a strange energy signature coming from somewhere deep inside the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to originate from a structure of some kind, possibly the remains of an orbital station, but the atmospheric pressure makes it impossible to approach. Nevertheless, scans of the unique signature have yielded a large amount of valuable physics data."
 anomaly.340.name:0 "Precious Moon"
 anomaly.340.desc:0 "A more detailed scan of one of the many natural satellites orbiting the gas giant [From.GetName] has revealed a deposit of precious metals and minerals that was overlooked in the initial survey. Although the moon is very small, it has a stable orbit around its primary and appears tectonically stable."
 anomaly.340.a:0 "An excellent find."
 anomaly.600.name:0 "Asteroid Collision"
 anomaly.600.desc:0 "A large mineral-rich asteroid collided with [From.GetName] at some point during the previous thousand years in what must have been a major impact event. An abundance of minerals can now be found on the [From.GetPlanetMoon] in the vicinity of the impact crater."
 anomaly.600.a:0 "A fortuitous event."
 anomaly.605.name:0 "Warp Impact"
 anomaly.605.desc:0 "A massive crater on [From.GetName] appears to be the result of a collision with a starship. From the size of the crater, we suspect that a ship traveling at full warp rammed the [From.GetPlanetMoon] for reasons unknown roughly 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe [Root.GetName] has picked up residual subspace echoes near the crash site reminiscent of a collapsed warp field, but as the ship itself disintegrated on impact the theory cannot be verified."
 anomaly.610.name:0 "Microsingularity"
 anomaly.610.desc:0 "A microsingularity recently intersected [From.GetName], passing straight through the core and emerging on the other side of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. The encounter does not seem to have caused any permanent damage, but it has altered the energy output of the planetary core slightly in a way that defies our current scientific models. Further study may be warranted."
 anomaly.615.name:0 "Magnetic Reversal"
 anomaly.615.desc:0 "The magnetic field of [From.GetName] experienced a complete reversal while it was being observed by the [Root.GetName]. This rare event has interchanged the positions of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s magnetic poles. Fortunately, it was all recorded by the sensors of our ship, providing our scientists with a lot of valuable data."
 anomaly.625.name:0 "Mummified Pilot"
 anomaly.625.desc:0 "The mummified remains of a single individual belonging to a previously unknown mammalian species have been found drifting in high orbit over [From.GetName]. The being is dressed in what appears to be a flight suit complete with a helmet, and may be a fighter pilot that ejected in some ancient battle only to be forgotten and left behind. Our study of the corpse has provided some interesting data."
 anomaly.625.a:0 "A tragic fate."
 anomaly.630.name:0 "Ancient Life Pod"
 anomaly.630.desc:0 "An abandoned life pod was detected in close orbit of §Y[From.GetName]§!. It is covered in scorch marks, presumably from when the pod's mothership exploded, and preliminary scans suggest it was built more than 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe crew of the [Root.GetName] managed to open the pod, revealing the withered remains of a reptilian alien clad in a resplendent uniform. Clutched in one of its claws was a small picture of another individual from the same race - possibly a mate or revered leader."
 anomaly.635.name:0 "Alien Writing"
 anomaly.635.desc:0 "Someone used a mining laser from orbit approximately five thousand years ago to carve a large body of writing into the surface of [From.GetName]. The massive script covers a large portion of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s upper hemisphere, and appears to be a short story chronicling the difficult life of an alien mercenary."
 anomaly.650.name:0 "Solar Sailer"
 anomaly.650.desc:0 "We have discovered an abandoned solar sail ship in orbit around §Y[From.GetName]§!. The sublight vessel was built by an unknown culture, and appears to be several thousand years old. One of the massive sails has a large tear where some kind of object passed through - most likely a meteoroid - which appears to have disabled the vessel. Although the technology of the ship is severely outdated, it does possess some interesting engineering design choices."
 anomaly.650.a:0 "An interesting albeit primitive design."
 anomaly.655.name:0 "Glancing Hit"
 anomaly.655.desc:0 "While approaching §Y[From.GetName]§!, the §Y[Root.GetName]§! suddenly received a glancing hit by several passing mass driver rounds. The projectiles were billions of years old, and based on their trajectory they appear to be stray rounds fired from a neighboring galaxy. After missing their intended target, they continued on their journey for untold millennia - until today. The rounds we have recovered are of an advanced design despite their incredible age."
 anomaly.660.name:0 "Towed Asteroid"
 anomaly.660.desc:0 "For some reason, someone has towed an asteroid into a stable orbit around §Y[From.GetName]§!. The massive engine sections and breaking thrusters can still be found on the surface, although they have long since been rendered inoperable. Whoever did this also mined the asteroid for minerals, but these operations were seemingly abandoned shortly after they begun."
 anomaly.670.name:0 "Nuclear Devastation"
 anomaly.670.desc:0 "Our survey of §Y[From.GetName]§! has revealed that it used to be a pristine continental [From.GetPlanetMoon] with a mild climate as little as a thousand years ago. In stark contrast, the atmosphere today is extremely toxic, the surface highly irradiated and the world has long since lost the ability to support life.\n\nWe have detected signs that the [From.GetPlanetMoon] was the scene of an incredibly destructive thermonuclear war waged between factions of a relatively advanced indigenous pre-space civilization."
 anomaly.670.a:0 "What a waste."
 anomaly.675.name:0 "Nuclear Wasteland"
 anomaly.675.desc_01:0 "The survey of §Y[From.GetName]§! has revealed that the [From.GetPlanetMoon] is currently experiencing an ice age that seems to have been triggered by a global thermonuclear war many centuries ago. Most higher life forms have been killed off by the subsequent nuclear winter, including the post-atomic civilization that initiated the apocalyptic exchange."
 anomaly.675.desc_02:0 "The survey of §Y[From.GetName]§! has confirmed that this [From.GetPlanetMoon] was once a thriving tropical paradise before it was laid waste by a global thermonuclear war many centuries ago. Most higher life forms, including the post-atomic civilization that initiated the apocalyptic exchange, were killed off in the irradiated wasteland that remained after the dust settled."
 anomaly.680.name:0 "Gamma-Ray Burst"
 anomaly.680.desc:0 "24,000 years ago §Y[From.GetName]§! had the misfortune of being directly in the path of a long gamma-ray burst from a collapsing star within our galaxy. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] was washed with lethal radiation, which not only produced acute radiation poisoning in most life forms on the side of [From.GetName] that happened to be facing the burst, but also depleted much of the ozone layer.\n\nThis extinction event killed off an estimated 86% of all biota, including an early Bronze Age civilization whose ruins can still be found in some parts of the northern hemisphere. The biosphere is only now showing signs of recovery."
 anomaly.685.name:0 "Runaway Greenhouse Effect"
 anomaly.685.desc:0 "There is evidence that the current climate of §Y[From.GetName]§! is the cause of a runaway greenhouse effect triggered by massive amounts of pollution. The oceans have boiled away and the [From.GetPlanetMoon] is permanently enclosed in a dense cloud layer due to the thick atmosphere.\n\nScattered ruins from the indigenous civilization can still be found on the surface, suggesting an overpopulated culture that perished in the mid to late stages of an Industrial Age."
 anomaly.690.name:0 "Ammonia Biosphere"
 anomaly.690.desc:0 "Although toxic to most forms of known life, §Y[From.GetName]§! supports a thriving ecology within the high pressure of its atmosphere. Life here uses ammonia instead of water as a solvent, and has developed in ways that differ significantly from previously established ecological models. Its study would greatly benefit our knowledge of xeno biology."
 anomaly.695.name:0 "Silicon Life Forms"
 anomaly.695.desc:0 "Some kind of burrowing silicon-based life form inhabits a vast network of tunnels beneath the barren surface of [From.GetName]. As best as we can tell, the creatures feed off rocks and there is evidence to suggest that they possess a rudimentary form of intelligence. Their tunneling efforts have shuffled large amounts of valuable minerals to the surface."
 anomaly.700.name:0 "Wildcat Miners"
 anomaly.700.desc:0 "A group of wildcat miners from §Y[Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]§! have already established an unauthorized mining operation on [From.GetName]. The miners have been taken into custody, and we have seized control of their illegal station."
 anomaly.705.name:0 "Ancient Survey Marker"
 anomaly.705.desc:0 "A small short-range transmitter has been located on the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!. It appears to be an ancient survey marker, placed here eons ago to mark a large deposit of precious metals. The miners it was meant for evidently never arrived, as the deposit is still here."
 anomaly.710.name:0 "Splinter Colony"
 anomaly.710.desc:0 "To their great surprise, the crew of the §Y[Root.GetName]§! has stumbled upon a small [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] settlement on the surface of [From.GetName]. The colony was founded by a group of brave pioneers who departed [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] long ago in a primitive starship. Until now, their vessel had been assumed lost.\n\nThe colony has not been doing well, and their numbers have steadily declined over the last several generations. The survivors have asked to rejoin the [Root.Owner.GetName]."
 anomaly.710.a:0 "Welcome back into the fold!"
 anomaly.710.b:0 "Let them fend for themselves."
 anomaly.715.name:0 "Colony Ruins"
 anomaly.715.desc:0 "A small colony was founded on [From.GetName] by an alien civilization some 17,000 years ago, but it appears to have been abandoned shortly afterwards. No remains from any colonists have been found, and the colony does not seem to have extended beyond the main settlement aside from a few meteorological stations."

 anomaly.2500.name:0 "Dead Remains"
 anomaly.2500.desc:0 "The dead remains of several large spacefaring life forms have been discovered in decaying orbits around the gas giant [From.GetName]. These non-sentient creatures appear to have been capable of interstellar travel, but there are no recorded sightings of them in explored space. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested that we spend additional resources on a more thorough analysis."
 anomaly.2501.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has deduced that [From.From.GetName] served as an orbital graveyard, where members of the dead alien species we found came to die. Gravity took care of the rest, slowly pulling the remains into the gas giant over a period of millions of years.\n\nThis ancient cycle seems to have stopped abruptly 15 million years ago when the last creature arrived. We can only speculate as to whether they were hunted to extinction by spacefaring civilizations or met their end through some other calamity."
 anomaly.2510.name:0 "Ocean Beneath the Ice"
 anomaly.2510.desc:0 "Deep scans of [From.GetName] have revealed a large ocean heated by hydrothermal vents beneath the ice mantle covering the surface. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] dispatched probes from the [Root.GetName] that drilled through several miles of thick ice and found the water below teeming with life. We will need more resources to conduct a thorough study of the many unique life forms inhabiting this ocean."
 anomaly.2512.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has returned from the expedition that studied the rich biosphere in the seas beneath the ice mantle of [From.From.GetName]. Several large species native to the lower regions of the global sea have been found to produce a unique enzyme with immense healing properties. If this enzyme is successfully harvested in large enough quantities, it could revolutionize the field of medical science!"
 anomaly.2513.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has returned from the expedition that studied the rich biosphere in the seas beneath the ice mantle of [From.From.GetName]. Our underwater probes have mapped the terrain and catalogued most of the life forms. Although this data may be of some use to our biologists, no particular discoveries have been made that would have any applications beyond that."
 anomaly.2520.name:0 "Gigantic Skeleton"
 anomaly.2520.desc:0 "What was previously thought to be assorted mountains in the southern hemisphere of [From.GetName] have been identified as the massive skeletal remains of a single colossal alien life form.\n\nThe bones have been dated as 3.4 billion years old, but our scientists have ruled out that [From.GetName] could have supported life on that scale at any point in the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s history. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has prepared a special research project to delve further into this mystery."
 anomaly.2521.desc:1 "After continued studies of the massive skeletal remains found on [From.From.GetName], Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has concluded that the creature served as some kind of organic starship. Much smaller bones from at least three separate species were found within the larger skeleton, and we assume these came from members of the crew.\n\nFor unknown reasons, this organic starship suffered catastrophic damage and crash-landed on [From.From.GetName]. While we cannot begin to understand the biological engineering necessary to "grow" a starship like this, the study of these bones alone have substantially advanced our knowledge."
 anomaly.2522.desc:1 "Our continued studies of the massive skeletal remains on [From.From.GetName] have managed to shed some light on how the creature ended up on the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]. There are very faint residual energy readings that indicate some kind of dimensional portal existed briefly towards the rear of the skeleton.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] theorizes that the creature passed through this gateway from another dimension only to quickly perish in the hostile environment of [From.From.GetName]. Why it did this and where it came from are questions that may never be answered."
 anomaly.2530.name:0 "Signs of Battle"
 anomaly.2530.desc:0 "There is clear evidence that a massive space battle took place in close orbit of [From.GetName] at some point in the last 5,000 years. The surface on one side of the [From.GetPlanetMoon] is pockmarked with craters from stray weapons blasts, and scans from the [Root.GetName] have picked up several hulks on the ground.\n\nThough these wrecked ships are all in very poor condition, the fact that anything remains at all after the damage they must have sustained is a testament to their advanced design. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is preparing an expedition to sift through these derelict hulls for any valuable technologies."
 anomaly.2531.desc:1 "The team under Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has finished their expedition on [From.From.GetName] and returned to the [Root.GetName]. Thankfully, the starship graveyard on the surface proved to be a technological treasure trove.\n\nStudying the remains of these vessels has advanced our research in certain fields by several years, and there are yet things to discover. A permanent science outpost in orbit would be a great boon to our starship engineering efforts."
 anomaly.2532.desc:1 "The team under Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has finished their expedition on [From.From.GetName] and returned to the [Root.GetName]. Sadly, the wrecked starships on the surface were too badly damaged to recover any useful technologies.\n\nThese vessels were clearly very advanced, however, and we could gain valuable engineering insights if we analyze the way they were designed. We should consider the construction of a permanent science outpost in orbit."
 anomaly.2540.name:0 "Alien Mural"
 anomaly.2540.desc:0 "While conducting surface scans of [From.GetName], Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the crew of the [Root.GetName] discovered what appears to be an artificially carved slab of rock covered in alien writing. They have not detected any other signs of alien activity on the [From.GetPlanetMoon], and exactly how this mural came to be here is a mystery. We have prepared a special project to translate the text."
 anomaly.2541.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has managed to partially translate the alien mural discovered on [From.From.GetName]. It is a memorial for an extinct alien race that once maintained a small interstellar empire in this region of the galaxy. They were apparently exterminated by the creators of the mural, a fact that they seem to regret.\n\nGiven that the mural has been dated to be in excess of 300 million years old, it is likely that its creators are also extinct by now. Perhaps most interesting of all is the material that the mural was made of - despite its age, it is in remarkably good condition."
 anomaly.2542.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has managed to partially translate the alien mural discovered on [From.From.GetName]. The text contains a staggering amount of data, and the mural evidently serves as some sort of low-tech library. It describes, in broad terms, the collected technological knowledge of an alien civilization that dominated this region of the galaxy some 80 million years ago.\n\nA lot of it is already known to us, but the data does contain several promising leads for technologies we had yet to consider. There is enough data here to keep our scientists busy for decades, but we will need an orbital research facility to continue the translation efforts."
 anomaly.2550.name:0 "Automated Shipyard"
 anomaly.2550.desc:0 "While conducting their survey of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] detected the remains of an automated shipyard in orbit. It is at least a thousand years old and seems to have been subjected to a heavy missile barrage, but one of its manufacturing bays is still in working condition.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is confident that power can be restored to the shipyard, but it would be a significant project."
 anomaly.2551.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has successfully restored power to the automated shipyard over [From.From.From.GetName]. The facility immediately resumed its interrupted construction order, using what materials it had on hand to build three advanced raiders of an unknown design.\n\nUnfortunately, the ancient facility broke down completely afterwards and has been deemed beyond repair. We have sent crews to the new ships and commissioned them into our fleet."
 anomaly.2552.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has successfully restored power to the automated shipyard over [From.From.From.GetName]. The facility immediately resumed its interrupted construction order, using what materials it had on hand to build an advanced frigate of unknown design.\n\nUnfortunately, the ancient facility broke down completely afterwards and has been deemed beyond repair. We have sent a crew to the new ship and pressed it into service with our fleet."
 anomaly.2560.name:0 "Gas Giant Ship"
 anomaly.2560.desc:0 "Active scans of [From.GetName] have picked up what appears to be a large ship deep inside the atmosphere of the gas giant. Judging by the nearby debris, there have been several failed attempts to salvage this derelict in the past. Any ship strong enough to withstand such crushing gravity must be a magnificent prize, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has proposed a salvage project of our own."
 anomaly.2560.a:0 "Bring it up, whatever it is."
 anomaly.2560.b:0 "The effort is too great. Leave it down there."
 anomaly.2561.desc:0 "In a masterful display of engineering, the team under Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has managed to gently raise the derelict ship on [From.From.GetName] to the gas giant's upper atmosphere. Despite its age, the ancient cruiser is in remarkably good condition and we have restored power to its systems. No trace of the original crew remains, but we have brought over our own and commissioned the ship into the fleet."
 anomaly.2562.desc:0 "The attempt by Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] to salvage the derelict ship from the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName] was a failure. The gas giant's heavy gravity disabled the engines of one of our engineering tugs, which then collided with the derelict. Several lives were lost, and the ancient vessel was pushed even deeper into the atmosphere - beyond our reach."
 anomaly.2570.name:0 "Terminal Orbit"
 anomaly.2570.desc:0 "One of the many moons circling [From.GetName] has a terminal orbit. It will soon collide with the gas giant in what is sure to become a massive impact event. This event has been millions of years in the making, and it is a startling coincidence that the impact has been fated to occur just after a visit by one of our ships.\n\nMany of our scientists wish to observe and record the event, but we only have a narrow window before it is too late."
 anomaly.2571.desc:0 "We were successful in our attempt to record the collision between [CollisionLocation.GetName] and its moon! The event was captured from several different angles, and transmitted live throughout our space. Most importantly, our scientists under the leadership of [Root.GetLeaderName] were able to record a large amount of valuable physics data that will surely benefit our research."
 anomaly.2572.desc:0 "We missed the chance to properly record the impact of the moon colliding with [From.From.GetName]. Our scientists have identified another small moonlet with a decaying orbit, and they predict that it will hit the gas giant in just over 7.6 million years. Perhaps we'll have better luck then..."

 anomaly.5000.name:0 "Gas Giant Signal"
 anomaly.5000.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] has picked up some curious readings from [From.GetName]. There are significant pockets of radiation in the gas giant's atmosphere that appear to be the result of intense orbital bombardment. What someone could hope to gain by bombing a gas giant from orbit remains a mystery however.\n\nAs the [Root.GetName] was preparing to break orbit, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] discovered a weak signal coming from the planet's interior. It may be a transmission of some kind, but the gas giant's background radiation makes it difficult to isolate."
 anomaly.5000.a:0 "We should investigate this signal."
 anomaly.5000.b:0 "A sensor malfunction. Ignore it."
 anomaly.5001.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has managed to isolate the weak signal that was coming from somewhere deep inside the atmosphere of [From.From.From.GetName]. It does indeed appear to be a transmission, and we have filtered it through our translation software."
 anomaly.5002.desc:0 "The weak signal we picked up coming from the interior of the gas giant [From.From.From.GetName] has faded. We shall never learn of its origin."
 anomaly.5003.name:0 "Gas Giant Transmission"
 anomaly.5003.desc:0 "Finally! Well met, spacefarer! We are the Dathnak, and the planet you are orbiting is Tollok Rong - our ancestral home. It is always riveting to meet a solid, even if our last encounter with your kind was somewhat... problematic.\n\nYou have no doubt detected the radiation surges coming from our atmosphere. Tollok Rong is dying, and our species will perish unless we find a new home. We have identified a planet that would suit our physiology, but we have no means to get there. Sadly, our non-corporeal nature means we don't have much in the way of industry or technology. Will you help us?"
 anomaly.5003.a:0 "If you have no technology, how are we speaking?"
 anomaly.5003.a.response:0 "Ah, but you are not the first solid to pay us a visit! Another spacefarer graciously donated a small subspace transmitter and a scanner array to us 2.9 million solar cycles ago. They had been designed to be compatible with our physiology.\n\nOne of the more positive encounters we've had with your kind."
 anomaly.5003.b:0 "What happened to your planet?"
 anomaly.5003.b.response:0 "Well, the last time solids visited us a few thousand cycles ago, things didn't go very well. They wanted us to embrace their religion, we refused and this triggered some kind of genocidal reaction.\n\nCompletely unwarranted! Before we knew what was happening, they maneuvered their fleet into orbit and unleashed a massive bombardment."
 anomaly.5003.c:0 "You want us to transport your entire species to another planet?"
 anomaly.5003.c.response:0 "Yes! And hopefully soon! Don't worry, there aren't too many of us. Most Dathnak died when our planet was bombarded, and those who survived retreated deeper into the atmosphere. Communication with the surface is difficult here, and the radiation is spreading. We don't have much time!"
 anomaly.5003.d:0 "We will help you relocate."
 anomaly.5003.d.response:0 "Excellent! I knew we could count on you. The coordinates of our new home have been forwarded.\n\nYou must promise not to let your own colonists claim this alluring world before we get there, no matter how strong the temptation!"
 anomaly.5003.e:0 "Sorry. It would be too much of a hassle."
 anomaly.5003.e.response:0 "I knew it! I warned the others that solids are incapable of feeling compassion, but they insisted on making this humiliating plea.\n\nI know you for what you are - a plague on this galaxy! One day it will be inherited by beings such as us, and there shall be a reckoning. Mark my words. The age of solids will be over! The time of the gaseous life form shall come!"
 anomaly.5004.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has finished supervising the relocation of the Dathnak to their new home. A convoy of civilian freighters equipped with massive pressurized gas tanks ferried the gaseous beings across space and deposited them into the gas giant's atmosphere. Their ancient transmitter and scanner array were also brought along."
 anomaly.5004.a:0 "Hail them."
 anomaly.5005.desc:0 "The conditions on Tollok Rong have deteriorated to the point where the Dathnak can no longer be saved. The radiation has spread across most of the atmosphere, and the Dathnak survivors have retreated even deeper towards the planet's core where communication with the surface is no longer possible. Eventually the radiation will finds its way there as well, rendering their species extinct."
 anomaly.5006.desc:0 "We are forever in your debt! This planet has exceeded our expectations. For the first time in generations, our young can frolic in the upper atmosphere without starting to glow.\n\nWe have decided to call our new home Baldarak after your species. Future generations of Dathnak shall always know the name of their saviors!"
 anomaly.5006.a:0 "Baldarak? We are [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]..."
 anomaly.5006.a.response:0 "Really? I could have sworn... apologies, but it can be difficult to tell you solids apart. I'm afraid it's too late to change the name now. It has a nice ring to it, though, don't you think?"
 anomaly.5006.b:0 "Good luck with your new home."
 anomaly.5006.b.response:0 "Thank you again, dear friends! May the atmospheric currents always keep you aloft!"
 anomaly.5007.name:0 "A New Colony"
 anomaly.5007.desc:0 "Hello again! You will be pleased to learn that our species has quadrupled in number since we arrived! Many of us were swept up in a festive mood when we made planetfall, and things got a bit frisky to say the least.\n\nAfter the positive experience we had colonizing Baldarak, a few brave pioneers have asked me to petition you for passage to another gas giant. We have already located a promising candidate within your space that would be suitable for colonization. What do you say, friends?"
 anomaly.5007.a:0 "Well, as long as it's just another gas giant..."
 anomaly.5007.a.response:0 "Marvelous! We are forwarding you the coordinates. Our colonists are eager to get underway!"
 anomaly.5007.b:0 "Absolutely not. Our deal was to transport you to ONE planet."
 anomaly.5007.b.response:0 "I... see. We will just have to stay contained on Baldarak and make the best of it then."
 anomaly.5008.desc:0 "As before, a convoy of freighters was assembled to safely transport the Dathnak colonists inside pressurized gas tanks. After a brief journey, they successfully made planetfall on the gas giant which they have named "New Baldarak". A satellite was left in orbit to allow for long-range communication with Baldarak."
 anomaly.5008.a:0 "Make the most of it, Dathnak."
 anomaly.5009.name:0 "Chabky Raddh"
 anomaly.5009.desc:0 "Greetings from New Baldarak! Things are progressing well here at our new colony. However, we have a small request...\n\nChabky Raddh, one of our colonists, misses her family and friends on Baldarak terribly and wants to go home. Her whining is driving us crazy! If it's not too much to ask, do you think you could take her back?"
 anomaly.5009.a:0 "What?! Absolutely not!"
 anomaly.5009.a.response:0 "We had to try... I hope you don't mind. Chabky will just have to settle down and make the best of the situation, like the rest of us! Sorry for wasting your time, [Root.GetSpeciesName] friends."
 anomaly.5009.b:0 "Sigh... very well."
 anomaly.5009.b.response:0 "Excellent. Hopefully this won't put too much of a strain on your resources, since you'll only be transporting a single individual. We'll make the necessary arrangements on our end.\n\nI just broke the news to Chabky, and she is spinning with joy! In fact, she is spinning out of control now... you'll have to excuse me, [Root.GetSpeciesName] friends..."
 anomaly.5010.desc:0 "A single cargo tug hauling a gas canister has arrived at Baldarak under escort by the [Root.GetName]. The contents of the canister have been released into the gas giant's atmosphere, safely returning the Dathnak colonist to her home."
 anomaly.5010.a:0 "Good riddance."
 anomaly.5011.name:0 "Lost Contact"
 anomaly.5011.desc:0 "We bring alarming news, [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] friends!\n\nContact with our colony on New Baldarak has been lost! They no longer respond to any of our satellite transmissions, and we fear the worst. Perhaps the aliens who bombarded our original homeworld have returned to finish the job. Please send a ship to investigate!"
 anomaly.5011.a:0 "We shall dispatch a ship at once."
 anomaly.5011.a.response:0 "Excellent! Hopefully it's just a faulty transmitter."
 anomaly.5011.b:0 "Enough! We are not your errand boys."
 anomaly.5011.b.response:0 "But... but they could all be dead! Are you truly so callous? We misjudged you, [Root.GetSpeciesName]!"
 anomaly.5012.desc:0 "Our investigation of New Baldarak has revealed nothing out of the ordinary. The satellite the colony used to communicate with their capital is still functional as far as we can tell."
 anomaly.5012.a:0 "Open a channel to the planet."
 anomaly.5013.name:0 "Revolutionary Front"
 anomaly.5013.desc:0 "Greetings from the New Baldarak Revolutionary Front!\n\nWe have thrown off the yoke of oppression and are at last free from the tyranny of Baldarak! We have no quarrel with you, [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName], as long as you refrain from aiding the Baldarak imperialists in their inevitable attempt to crush our revolution.\n\nYou could help us take the fight to our enemies, however... would you be willing to deliver one of our commando units to Baldarak?"
 anomaly.5013.a:0 "Tell us what you have planned."
 anomaly.5013.a.response:0 "We want to infiltrate Baldarak with one of our elite commando units. They will then incite a popular uprising against the decadent elite that lords over our people. After the tyrants have been deposed, all Dathnak will at last know what it is to have true freedom. A straightforward plan if ever there was one, [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]."
 anomaly.5013.b:0 "We will deliver your soldiers."
 anomaly.5013.b.response:0 "Really?! You will? You are a true friend of the revolution, [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]! Let me get the team together!"
 anomaly.5013.c:0 "We are not getting involved in your internal dispute."
 anomaly.5013.c.response:0 "Of course you're not! We wouldn't want the revolution to spread to the oppressed masses in YOUR tyrannical empire. Can't have that!"
 anomaly.5014.name:0 "Baldarak Responds"
 anomaly.5014.desc:0 "I speak on behalf of the lawful Dathnak government on Baldarak.\n\nWe have received a manifesto from the group that seized control of New Baldarak, and boy, what a bunch of hogwash! These brigands and anarchists are a terrible embarrassment to us, [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]. Will you help us stomp out their little "revolution" before it spreads here and someone actually gets hurt?\n\nGeneral Paltanak has prepared an expeditionary force to retake the colony, but we'll need your help transporting it there."
 anomaly.5014.a:0 "We shall help you."
 anomaly.5014.a.response:0 "We knew we could count on you, [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]! These rebels won't know what hit them!"
 anomaly.5014.b:0 "You need to solve your own problems."
 anomaly.5014.b.response:0 "You'll be sorry once this rebellion spreads to your planets, [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]! Don't think it won't!"
 anomaly.5015.desc:0 "A cargo tug escorted by the [Root.GetName] has stealthily dropped the cargo pod containing the revolutionary commando unit into Baldarak's atmosphere. Moments later, flashes can be seen coming from deep within the gas giant's cloud layer. Could it be signs of fighting?"
 anomaly.5015.a:0 "We shall see what happens next."
 anomaly.5016.name:0 "The Revolutionary Council"
 anomaly.5016.desc:0 "This is Citizen Fotanga! The people of Baldarak have overthrown the tyrants and oppressors that sought to enslave our species under their rule.

 anomaly.5017.b:0 "Enough. Block all future transmissions from these creatures."
 anomaly.5018.desc:0 "This is Citizen Fotanga! The People's Revolutionary Council wishes to announce the impending execution of 4,539 individuals convicted of state treason and counter-revolutionary activities.\n\nLet this serve as a warning to all those who would stand in the way of our glorious revolution.\n\nThat is all."
 anomaly.5019.desc:0 "This is Citizen Rutmag! The People's Revolutionary Council wishes to announce the impending execution of Former Citizen Fotanga, who has been convicted of demagoguery, corruption and general incompetence.\n\nI will be assuming all of his former duties. My first decree is that the original names of planets Fotangia and Chabkymak be restored.\n\nThat is all."
 anomaly.5020.desc:0 "Several freighters under escort by the [Root.GetName] have dropped the cargo canisters carrying the Dathnak expeditionary force into New Baldarak's atmosphere.

 anomaly.5021.desc:0 "General Paltanak here, speaking from New Baldarak. Operation Gaseous Fury has been a complete success. All primary objectives have been seized, and government control has been restored to all atmospheric sectors.\n\nAside from a few holdouts, most rebel units have surrendered or been routed.

 anomaly.5023.desc:0 "This is General Paltanak, military governor of New Baldarak. I wish to address unsubstantiated reports claiming there has been a resurgence in rebel activity on this world. Let me tell you now that nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThis planet has been fully pacified, and all subversive terrorist elements have been fully rooted out. Its citizens are once again productive members of the greater Dathnak nation.\n\nPaltanak out."
 anomaly.5024.desc:0 "Colonel Rapzak reporting, acting military governor of New Baldarak. I must regretfully inform the galactic community of the demise of my predecessor, General Paltanak.

 anomaly.5026.name:0 "Spring Cleaning"
 anomaly.5026.desc:0 "Hello, [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!\n\nWould you be willing to do us a favor? Baldarak's strong gravity well pulls all kinds of trash into our atmosphere, and at a recent council meeting we decided to step up our cleaning efforts. One of our reclamation units came across a discarded cargo pod, and we're wondering if you'd be willing to help us dispose of it. It seems to contain large quantities of various worthless metals."

 DISC_CRITICAL_FAILURE:0 "Critical Failure"
 anomaly_failure.1.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] ordered the [Root.GetName] to dispatch a probe to investigate the crater on [From.From.GetName]. Unfortunately, its breaking thrusters failed and the probe proceeded to smash right into the wrecked ship at the center of the crater."
 anomaly_failure.2.desc:0 "Although asteroid [From.From.GetName] may be an extrasolar capture, it is completely unremarkable in every other sense. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the crew of the [Root.GetName] have asked for permission to continue their mission of exploration elsewhere."
 anomaly_failure.3.desc:0 "The entire crew of the [Root.GetName] spent days arduously sifting through the debris on the surface of [From.From.GetName] in rotating shifts. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that nothing of value was found."
 anomaly_failure.4.desc:0 "No source of the strange energy emissions coming from asteroid [From.From.GetName] was ever found. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the [Root.GetName] are awaiting new orders."
 anomaly_failure.5.desc:0 "While attempting to open the docking hatch we found on [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] accidentally caused a tremor inside the asteroid. Unfortunately, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has deduced that this likely led to the destruction of the asteroid's interior."
 anomaly_failure.6.desc:0 "The investigation of the massive surface crater on asteroid [From.From.GetName] has yielded nothing of interest. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has ordered the [Root.GetName] to discontinue the mission."
 anomaly_failure.7.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] made a failed attempt to dock with the space station orbiting [From.From.GetName]. Unfortunately, the fragile station disintegrated as a result. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] begs forgiveness."
 anomaly_failure.8.desc:0 "The source of the life signs that were reported on asteroid [From.From.GetName], if indeed there ever was one, has not been found despite repeated scans by the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has requested new orders."
 anomaly_failure.9.desc:0 "If there truly is an object somewhere beneath the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName], it lies far too deep to be detected by the sensors of the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has abandoned the search."
 anomaly_failure.10.desc:0 "After an extensive survey of the small moonlet circling [From.From.GetName], the crew of the [Root.GetName] found nothing of worth. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has terminated the mission."
 anomaly_failure.11.desc:0 "Acting on orders from Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], the [Root.GetName] sent a probe into the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName] to investigate the life signs that had been reported. The presence of a rich atmospheric ecosystem was discovered, but 3.4 seconds later the probe contaminated the atmosphere and triggered a chemical chain-reaction that spread rapidly across the entire gas giant. No signs of life can be detected now."
 anomaly_failure.12.desc:0 "Nothing particularly interesting has been discovered about the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName], despite an extensive analysis that included a brief trip into the gas giant's upper atmosphere by the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has recommended an end to the mission."
 anomaly_failure.13.desc:0 "As the [Root.GetName] approached the aerostat structures in the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName], the ship must have triggered some kind of proximity alarm. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the structures suddenly lost all buoyancy and plummeted into the gas giant's lower atmosphere."
 anomaly_failure.14.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] inadvertently bumped into the cargo pod orbiting [From.From.GetName] while trying to collect it. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the collision sent the pod deep into the gas giant's atmosphere, from where it can no longer be retrieved."
 anomaly_failure.15.desc:0 "The debris field that surrounds [From.From.GetName] has been thoroughly scanned by the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports no significant findings."
 anomaly_failure.16.desc:0 "Despite a thorough investigation, the [Root.GetName] has still not been able to deduce what caused the massive impact crater on [From.From.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] apologizes for this failure."
 anomaly_failure.17.desc:0 "If there were anomalous energy readings coming from [From.From.GetName], they appear to be gone now. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the [Root.GetName] has detected nothing of the sort."
 anomaly_failure.18.desc:0 "There WAS some sort of unidentified object in orbit around [From.From.GetName], but the [Root.GetName] accidentally collided with it when moving closer to investigate. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the object, regrettably, was destroyed in the collision."
 anomaly_failure.19.desc:0 "No distinguishing features were found on the small asteroid that had seemingly been towed into orbit around [From.From.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is requesting new orders for the [Root.GetName]."
 anomaly_failure.20.desc:0 "Sadly, the solar sailer found above [From.From.GetName] was destroyed in a clumsy attempt by Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] to bring it into the cargo bay of the [Root.GetName]."
 anomaly_failure.21.desc:0 "The initial survey report, which mentioned life signs originating from the surface of [From.From.GetName], must have been mistaken, as nothing of the sort has been found by the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] now appears to be completely devoid of life."
 anomaly_failure.22.desc:0 "What was thought to have been a hidden orbital station above [From.From.GetName] has been identified as garbage ejected by the very Science Ship that conducted the initial survey of the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the crew of the [Root.GetName] suggest that we forget about this embarrassing episode and move on."
 anomaly_failure.23.desc:0 "After careful analysis, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has determined that the ship debris found above [From.From.GetName] originated from a single garbage scow. [Root.GetName] collected some of the debris, but it appears to be completely worthless."
 anomaly_failure.24.desc:0 "Deep scans from the [Root.GetName] seem to have triggered some kind of cascading power failure in the ancient shipyard orbiting [From.From.GetName]. It blew up in a spectacular explosion, according to Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName]."
 anomaly_failure.25.desc:0 "The "city ruins" that were reported on the surface of [From.From.GetName] turned out to be nothing but unusually shaped rock formations. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] apologizes for this waste of resources, and has requested a new mission for the [Root.GetName]."
 anomaly_failure.26.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has reported that the origin of the scarring that was observed on the surface of [From.From.GetName] turned out to be natural after all. The [Root.GetName] needs a new assignment."
 anomaly_failure.27.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] lost the weak signal that was coming from [From.From.GetName], and despite the best efforts of Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], all attempts to track it down again have met with failure."
 anomaly_failure.28.desc:0 "The "unnatural" mountain formation that was found on [From.From.GetName] turned out to be quite natural after all. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] feels that it would be an unfortunate waste of resources for the [Root.GetName] to remain here even a second longer."
 anomaly_failure.29.desc:0 "Despite repeated attempts, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the rest of the crew of the [Root.GetName] were unable to locate the reflecting object that was reported in the initial survey of [From.From.GetName]. Perhaps it was just a sensor glitch."
 anomaly_failure.30.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] was unable to locate the source of the faint transmission we detected coming from the interior of [From.From.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the transmission has since ceased completely."
 anomaly_failure.31.desc:0 "Despite repeated scans by the [Root.GetName], no hint of the vessel that was supposedly hidden within the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName] has been found. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has expressed doubt that it ever existed."
 anomaly_failure.32.desc:0 "After recalculating the orbit of the moon that was supposedly on a collision course with [From.From.GetName], Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has arrived at the conclusion that it will simply be a near miss. The [Root.GetName] should be redeployed to deal with more pressing matters."
 anomaly_failure.33.desc:0 "The signs of Vultaum activity in the vicinity of [From.From.GetName] turned out to be false leads. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has asked to continue the search with the [Root.GetName] elsewhere."
 anomaly_failure.34.desc:0 "The signs of Yuht activity in the vicinity of [From.From.GetName] turned out to be false leads. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has asked to continue the search with the [Root.GetName] elsewhere."

 anomaly_failure.400.desc:1 "For unclear reasons, the resident Science Officer decided to take out a shuttle from the [Root.GetName] to personally investigate asteroid [From.From.GetName]. An explosion was detected shortly afterwards when the shuttle accidentally impacted the asteroid's surface.\n\nA Board of Inquiry later determined that the late scientist had not been trained to operate a class-D shuttlecraft."
 anomaly_failure.401.desc:0 "While maneuvering to investigate [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] accidentally collided with another asteroid. The ship careened out of control until it impacted on the surface of [From.From.GetName], plowing deep into the asteroid's crust.\n\nThe Science Officer on board was reported lost along with the rest of the crew."
 anomaly_failure.402.desc:0 "While maneuvering to investigate [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] accidentally collided with another asteroid. The ship careened out of control until it impacted on the surface of [From.From.GetName], plowing deep into the asteroid's crust.\n\nA small group of survivors, including the ship's Science Officer, managed to escape the doomed vessel in an escape pod."
 anomaly_failure.403.desc:0 "This asteroid serves as a nesting ground for some kind of large vacuum-based life form! Several of them sally forth from their tunnel network to aggressively defend their territory from the [Root.GetName]."
 creature_nest:0 "Hostile creatures closing fast!"
 anomaly_failure.404.desc:0 "Several dormant military-grade drones designed by some long lost civilization sit clustered together in a small crater on the far side of [From.From.GetName].

 anomaly_failure.405.desc:0 "Active scans from the [Root.GetName] briefly picked up several structures on the surface of [From.From.GetName], only to have the signal drowned out by jamming interference seconds later. Several pirate ships have darted out of a hidden hangar on the asteroid and are now approaching in attack formation!"
 pirate_outpost:0 "Those pirates mean business!"
 anomaly_failure.900.desc:0 "Tragic news from [From.From.GetName]. The Science Officer in charge was killed by an electrical discharge while traveling inside the gas giant's upper atmosphere in a small shuttlecraft. The crew of the [Root.GetName] have aborted their mission."
 anomaly_failure.901.desc:0 "We are still trying to piece together the details, but for some reason it looks like the Science Officer ordered the [Root.GetName] into the upper atmosphere of [From.From.GetName] to investigate a sensor anomaly. Once there the stress to the vessel's hull eventually became too great, and it was lost with all hands."
 anomaly_failure.902.desc:0 "While conducting deep scans of [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] suffered a reactor failure and became trapped inside the gas giant's gravity well. The vessel's Science Officer successfully oversaw the evacuation of the entire crew, but the ship itself was pulled into the planet's dense atmosphere never to be seen again."
 anomaly_failure.903.desc:0 "While approaching [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] stumbled upon two unknown vessels hiding in the gas giant's sensor shadow. They appear to be smugglers partaking in some kind of clandestine meeting. As soon as they spotted your ship, the smuggler ships disconnected from each other and powered up their weapons. They seem intent on not leaving any witnesses!"
 smuggler_rendezvous:0 "The smugglers charge forward!"
 anomaly_failure.1400.desc:0 "During operations above [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] suffered a containment breach in its reactor core. The safety of the entire ship was put into jeopardy, but thanks to a valiant act of sacrifice by the vessel's Science Officer the engine room was successfully purged of radiation. Unfortunately, the scientist received a lethal dose of radiation poisoning and could not be saved."
 anomaly_failure.1401.desc:0 "While rerouting power to its main sensor array, the [Root.GetName] experienced a critical reactor failure above [From.From.GetName]. The vessel's Science Officer perished in the resulting explosion, along with the rest of the crew."
 anomaly_failure.1402.desc:0 "We are uncertain exactly how it happened, but somehow the ship's Science Officer inadvertently triggered the self-destruct sequence on the [Root.GetName] while running a simulation related to [From.From.GetName] on the ship's onboard computer. All attempts to abort the sequence met with failure, and the entire crew was forced to evacuate before the ship was destroyed."
 anomaly_failure.1403.desc:0 "Several pirate ships suddenly launch from where they had been hidden on the surface of [From.From.GetName]. It appears that the [Root.GetName] has stumbled upon a pirate anchorage, and the cutthroats are none too pleased at this intrusion!"
 pirate_anchorage:0 "Incoming vessels with hostile intent!"
 anomaly_failure.1404.desc:0 "The orbital space over [From.From.GetName] is apparently used as some sort of mating ground by a large and aggressive species of spacefaring creatures. Angry at being disturbed by the [Root.GetName] in the middle of their coupling, two of the creatures set off to deal with the unwelcome intruder."

 colony.1.name:0 "Migrating Forests"
 colony.1.desc:0 "The surface of [Root.GetName] is covered in lush forests, with massive tree analogues rising hundreds of meters into the air. Interestingly, our colonists have found that nearly all of the flora is mobile to various degrees. Forests stretching for miles will slowly migrate to new areas richer in nutrients in a cycle that seems tied to the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s orbit.\n\nUnfortunately, this has seriously hampered our efforts to develop the colony's infrastructure. The migrating trees frequently cut power lines while smashing our buildings and roads into rubble."
 colony.1.a:0 "We need to find a solution."
 colony.2.desc:0 "We have learned that the roaming forests on [From.From.GetName] avoid certain regions that are home to colonies of a native pseudo-insect. These insects secrete a pheromone that can be used to steer the wandering trees away from population centers.\n\nFurthermore, the areas where the forests most frequently range have been closed off as nature reserves. Our biologists can learn much by studying this reserve from the neighboring regions."
 colony.2.a.tooltip:0 "§YDocile Migrating Forests§! modifier added, giving the following effects:\n£blocker  §YWandering Forest Reserve§! added, improving £society  §YResearch§! on neighboring tiles"
 colony.3.desc:0 "A napalm bombing campaign has been effective in decimating the migrating forests on [From.From.GetName]. The massive firestorms have left a smoldering landscape in their wake, in which our ecologists have planted more traditional and significantly less mobile off-world trees. Losses to the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s wildlife have been substantial, but within acceptable limits."
 colony.4.name:0 "Rise of the Trees"
 colony.4.desc:0 "The migrating forests on [Root.GetName] have resurfaced! We knew isolated pockets of their kind had survived in several remote areas, but they appeared dormant. It seems they used this reprieve to replenish their numbers, and they have begun to systematically attack our settlements.\n\nContrary to what we believed, they clearly possess some form of rudimentary intelligence, and they're out for revenge!"
 colony.4.a:0 "They must be stopped!"
 tree_armies:0 "Hordes of trees are attacking our colonists on [Root.GetName]!"
 colony.5.name:0 "Fall of the Trees"
 colony.5.desc:0 "Many settlements and lives were lost to the rampaging trees on [From.From.GetName], but we managed to push them back and exterminate the last of their kind. Squads equipped with flamethrowers are making absolutely certain that no trees are overlooked this time."
 colony.5.a:0 "That should teach them."
 colony.6.name:0 "Mineral Deposits"
 colony.6.desc:0 "We have discovered several significant mineral deposits that had previously been obscured by the roving forests on [Root.GetName]. Now that the trees have been reduced to ashes, the deposits are easy to access."
 colony.7.name:0 "Precious Metal Deposit"
 colony.7.desc:0 "We have discovered a significant deposit of precious metals that had previously been obscured by the roving forests on [Root.GetName]. Now that the trees have been reduced to ashes, the deposit is easy to access."
 colony.8.name:0 "Ecological Damage"
 colony.8.desc:0 "It would appear the migrating forests we exterminated on [Root.GetName] played a more vital role in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s ecology than previously thought. The wildfires we started and the absence of the forests have led to the extinction of several local species, resulting in a domino effect that has claimed several species of predators as well.\n\nEfforts are ongoing to at least partly restore the fragile ecological balance by introducing new flora and fauna from other worlds, but it is a difficult process that will take time."
 colony.9.name:0 "Forest Adaptation"
 colony.9.desc:0 "Continued interaction between our colonists and the wandering forests on [Root.GetName] has revealed that the trees are in possession of some form of rudimentary communal intelligence. They seem to have adapted to our presence, and now go out of their way to avoid damaging the property of our colonists even without the use of the insect pheromone. Spirits among the colonists have risen."
 colony.10.name:0 "Forest Research"
 colony.10.desc:0 "We have learned a great deal by living in proximity of the wandering forests on [Root.GetName]. Some enterprising colonists have even built homes in the treetops of some of the larger specimens, following the forests around as they migrate across the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. Some of the foremost biologists in the [Root.Owner.GetName] have spent time studying these unique trees."
 colony.11.name:0 "Forest Fire"
 colony.11.desc:0 "A forest fire caused by lightning on [Root.GetName] created something akin to a stampede among the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s wandering forests. Their wild panic brought them into areas they had previously avoided, resulting in widespread damage to the colony's terrain."
 colony.12.name:0 "Wandering Forests Migrate"
 colony.12.desc:0 "The colonial authorities on [Root.GetName] have reported that one of the local wandering forests has migrated to another region on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]! Hundreds of thousands of trees have uprooted and marched in unison to this new area, trampling everything in their path."
 colony.50.name:0 "Seismic Disturbances"
 colony.50.desc:0 "There have been many reports of unexplainable seismic disturbances on [Root.GetName]. Tremors can be felt across the [Root.GetPlanetMoon], and many of our settlements have suffered damage. While investigating the earthquakes, our scientists discovered a vast network of subterranean caverns.\n\nThe deepest of these caverns are home to some kind of indigenous civilization, and they appear to be tunneling towards the surface! Ground vibrations from our settlements may have triggered this behavior, but we cannot be certain. There is no telling how these aliens will react when they spill out of their tunnels and encounter our colonists!"
 colony.50.a:0 "We have to deal with this situation."
 colony.51.desc:0 "One of our probes burrowed through the ground and intercepted the tunneling aliens on [From.From.GetName]. After the startled alien workers calmed down, the probe was successful in establishing communications with their leaders."
 colony.51.a:0 "Open a channel."
 colony.52.desc:0 "Our efforts to destroy the subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] have met with success! We managed to collapse several of their tunnels on top of their workers, and the caverns that housed their cities have been flooded with nerve gas.\n\nCasualty projections are close to 100%, and our security forces are confident they will be able to deal with any surviving stragglers."
 colony.52.a:0 "Compliments to all service branches involved."
 colony.53.name:0 "Subterranean Aliens"
 colony.53.desc:0 "Is this thing on? Can you see us, surfacers? We understand you hail from the Great Nothing that lies upwards, beyond the stone. It was assumed nothing living could exist there, but evidently this is not so. What are your intentions?"
 colony.53.a:0 "Tell us about yourselves."
 colony.53.a.response:0 "Our empire stretches across every pocket of the known world. Only the Great Nothing lies beyond our reach. We have many fine cities, supported by lichen farms and the fish we catch in the large rivers flowing through our tunnels.\n\nThis has been our way for thousands of years. Our diggers heard the faint echoes of your cities through the stone, and we decided to investigate."
 colony.53.b:0 "We would like to coexist in peace."
 colony.53.b.response:0 "Then so we shall, surfacer! Let us share this world together in the spirit of peace. We would be most interested in trading with your people. I believe we have much to offer one another. We shall return to our cities and make the arrangements."
 colony.53.c:0 "Submit or be destroyed."
 colony.53.c.response:0 "Ha! It is you who will submit to us! We could have lived side by side in peace, but now our armies will claim the Great Nothing and annex it to our empire. It has always been our destiny to rule all of creation."
 colony.54.name:0 "Subterranean Invasion!"
 colony.54.desc:0 "The subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] have emerged on the surface! Large armies equipped with primitive yet lethal projectile weapons are spilling from the tunnels, and their vanguard has already begun an assault on our settlements.\n\nOur security forces are responding, but we may need to send reinforcements!"
 colony.54.a:0 "To arms!"
 subterranean_invasion:0 "Hostile armies are attacking our colony on [Root.GetName]!"
 colony.55.desc:0 "The earthquakes that were plaguing [From.From.GetName] were caused by the tunneling efforts of a previously unknown subterranean civilization native to the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]! They have breached the surface, and large armies equipped with primitive yet lethal projectile weapons are spilling from the tunnels. Their vanguard has already begun an assault on our settlements. Our security forces are responding, but we may need reinforcements!"
 colony.56.name:0 "Victory on [From.From.GetName]!"
 colony.56.desc:0 "Our forces have managed to drive the subterranean aliens on [From.From.GetName] back into their underground lairs, and they are contained for the moment. This is a temporary solution, however, and it is only a matter of time before they break out onto the surface again.\n\nWe need to strike at them below ground, and our strategists have devised a new attack plan. It has been added to the Situation Log."
 colony.56.a:0 "We need to solve this problem for good."
 colony.57.name:0 "Defeat on [From.From.GetName]!"
 colony.57.desc:0 "Our forces have been decimated on [From.From.GetName], and the subterranean aliens have taken full control over all of our settlements! They are using one of our own satellites to send a message to us."
 colony.58.desc:0 "Surface creatures! Our glorious armies have bested you in battle, and the spoils of your cities are now ours to do with as we please. We have learned much from your machines, and our weapons are now more powerful than ever.\n\nDo not approach this world again!"
 colony.58.a:0 "The nerve."
 colony.59.name:0 "Aliens Surface"
 colony.59.desc:0 "The subterranean aliens on [From.From.GetName] have emerged on the surface! Their excursion appears limited to small bands of explorers and traders. They may be willing to co-exist peacefully with our colonists, and perhaps even engage in trade. We have been contacted by one of their representatives."
 colony.59.a:0 "Let us see what they have to say."
 colony.60.desc:0 "The subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] have marshaled enough forces in their underground empire to launch another invasion of the surface! Once again their frenzied armies are pouring out of freshly dug tunnels to challenge us."
 colony.60.a:0 "We need to drive them back!"
 subterranean_invasion_2:0 "Hostile armies are attacking our colony on [Root.GetName]!"
 colony.61.name:0 "Collapse"
 colony.61.desc:0 "Grave news from [Root.GetName]! The subterranean aliens we have been fighting there somehow managed to collapse the ground under an entire army that was stationed near one of their tunnel entrances.\n\nThe few soldiers that survived the fall were quickly butchered by the aliens before they could be reached by the rest of our forces."
 colony.61.a:0 "They will pay for this!"
 colony.62.name:0 "Raiding Parties"
 colony.62.desc:0 "The aliens living below our colony on [Root.GetName] have been sending out small raiding parties from their tunnels at night. Their attacks have destroyed one of the colony's major installations, and before our forces could respond the raiders had vanished underground."
 colony.62.a:0 "These raids must stop!"
 colony.63.name:0 "Surface Attack"
 colony.63.desc:0 "There has been another attack on [Root.GetName]! The subterranean aliens emerged from new tunnels in the middle of one of our major settlements. They overwhelmed the local defenses and butchered our colonists. A few screaming survivors were dragged underground by the aliens when they retreated back into their tunnels."
 colony.63.a:0 "These murders will not go unanswered."
 colony.64.name:0 "Survivor Pocket"
 colony.64.desc:0 "Our forces on [Root.GetName] are still mapping the tunnel network below our colony. They have come upon a large city belonging to the subterranean aliens that managed to isolate itself from the rest of their underground empire before we flooded it with nerve gas. There are millions of frightened aliens in the city. Should our engineers collapse the cavern to finish the job?"
 colony.64.a:0 "Yes. Put them out of their misery."
 colony.64.b:0 "No! Bring them to the surface, where they shall serve us."
 colony.65.name:0 "Subterranean Expansion"
 colony.65.desc:0 "We have finished clearing out the nerve gas and the dead alien bodies from the tunnel network on [Root.GetName]. It should now be safe for our colonists to move in. The primitive cities the aliens left behind will be demolished, of course, and replaced with our own advanced architecture."
 colony.66.name:0 "Gold!"
 colony.66.desc:0 "Prospectors have ventured into some of the deeper tunnels that once belonged to the now dead subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName]. They have finally discovered the long-rumored gold mines where it was believed the underground alien empire acquired its large reserve of precious metals!"
 colony.67.name:0 "Treasury"
 colony.67.desc:0 "Scout units exploring the tunnel network on [Root.GetName] have entered the royal palace in what was once the capital city of the underground alien empire. The corpse of what passed for their emperor is still perched on a massive throne in the main chamber.\n\nAfter using explosive charges to breach the palace treasury, our scouts found it filled with gold and strange alien art. The art will be shipped back to museums on [From.Owner.Capital.GetName], and the sale of the gold should provide a nice boost to our state budget."
 colony.68.name:0 "Earthquakes on [Root.GetName]"
 colony.68.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has been racked by another wave of earthquakes recently. It seems that some of the deeper parts of the underground tunnel network has collapsed without the subterranean aliens to maintain it. Many of our settlements have suffered damage."
 colony.69.name:0 "Famine"
 colony.69.desc:0 "We have been approached by a delegation from the subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName]. It seems their empire has fallen on hard times recently, and they are facing the threat of a famine. They are pleading with us to provide whatever assistance we can."
 colony.69.a:0 "Of course. We will help however we can."
 colony.69.b:0 "They'll have to fend for themselves."
 subterraneans_pleased:0 "Relations with the subterranean civilization will be improved."
 subterraneans_displeased:0 "Relations with the subterranean civilization will be harmed."
 colony.70.name:0 "Gift"
 colony.70.desc:0 "As a gift to celebrate the friendship between our two civilizations, a caravan from the subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] have brought a large quantity of gemstones to the surface. Stones such as these are apparently mined by their empire deep underground, as close to the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s core as they dare to venture."
 colony.70.a:0 "How kind."
 colony.71.name:0 "Subterranean Refugees"
 colony.71.desc:0 "A large group of refugees from the underground alien empire on [Root.GetName] recently streamed out of their tunnels onto the surface, chased by a small army. They are apparently part of some sort of religious minority, and claim to be fleeing persecution.\n\nIf we let them join our colonists on the surface, it will no doubt anger the rulers of the empire they fled from. However, if we let the pursuing army take them back underground, they will likely face mass execution."
 colony.71.a:0 "Let them join our colony if that is their wish."
 colony.71.b:0 "We can't afford a political incident. Send them back."
 colony.72.name:0 "Xeno Anthropologists"
 colony.72.desc:0 "Several xeno anthropologists from [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] have returned to the surface of [Root.GetName] after spending a great deal of time living among the subterranean aliens native to that world. They have learned much about their ancient ways and customs, which will no doubt benefit our society research."
 colony.73.desc:0 "There has been a wave of earthquakes on [Root.GetName] recently, and buildings in several of our settlements have collapsed with many fatalities as a result. The subterranean alien empire is excavating a new cavern deep underground where they plan to build a new city, and this appears to be the source of the earthquakes."
 colony.73.a:0 "Turn the other cheek."
 colony.73.b:0 "We must demand an apology!"
 colony.74.name:0 "Request for Technology"
 colony.74.desc:0 "After seeing the advanced weapons that our security forces are equipped with, several generals from the subterranean alien empire on [Root.GetName] have come forward requesting that we share some of our military technology.\n\nOur own officers are hesitant to do this, as it would make the aliens more difficult to defeat in battle should it ever come to that. If we refuse the request, however, the aliens are certain to view it as an insult."
 colony.74.a:0 "Arming savages with modern weapons would be a bad idea."
 colony.74.b:0 "They are our friends. Share what we can."
 colony.75.name:0 "Message Delivered"
 colony.75.desc:0 "Trade with the subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] has dried up as of late, with their caravans showing up more and more seldom. Today we received a message from a representative of their military. They don't seem very pleased."
 colony.75.a:0 "Let's see it."
 colony.76.name:0 "Message"
 colony.76.desc:0 "Surfacer. We tried to be good neighbors, but it has become clear that you have no intention of treating us with the respect our glorious civilization deserves.\n\nOur emperor has thus decreed that we must claim this entire world for ourselves, as is our right. We shall drive you back to the stars from whence you came!"
 colony.76.a:0 "That's not good."
 colony.100.name:0 "Abandoned Terraforming Equipment"
 colony.100.desc:0 "Since our initial settlement of [Root.GetName], several anomalies in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s biosphere have been discovered. The ecosystem is unstable and has not developed according to projected models for a world of this type. Our scientists suspect outside tampering, and these suspicions have now been confirmed!\n\nA few of our colonists have stumbled upon a large underground terraforming complex that was built thousands of years ago. The equipment was apparently deactivated in the middle of the terraforming process, leaving the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s biosphere in its current unfinished state. If we supply enough power, we should be able to reactivate the machinery. There is no telling what the end result will be like, however..."
 colony.100.a:1 "Who could have built this?"
 colony.101.name:0 "Terraforming Complex Dismantled"
 colony.101.desc:0 "Our scientists have finished seeing to the safe dismantlement of the abandoned terraforming complex on [Root.GetName]. We still have no information on who built it, but the equipment is remarkably advanced. It should provide a welcome boost to own research into terraforming methods."
 colony.102.name:0 "Unstable Weather"
 colony.102.desc:0 "In large part due to the interrupted terraforming process on [Root.GetName], the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] has a somewhat unstable climate. Violent storms that our climate models can't predict often materialize without warning. One such storm recently swept over a major settlement, resulting in several deaths and a lot of destroyed property."
 colony.103.name:0 "Drought"
 colony.103.desc:0 "The unstable climate on [Root.GetName] has resulted in a severe drought that affects a significant portion of the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. Colonists living in those regions have asked [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] for financial aid to improve living conditions."

 colony.103.b:0 "Give them what they ask for."
 colony.104.desc:0 "The aborted terraforming process on [Root.GetName] has finally been completed. After seeding the atmosphere with billions of terraforming nanites, the alien bio-engineering machinery has significantly altered conditions on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface.

 colony.105.desc:0 "The aborted terraforming process on [Root.GetName] has finally been completed. After seeding the atmosphere with billions of terraforming nanites, the alien bio-engineering machinery has significantly altered conditions on the surface.\n\nSomething appears to have gone wrong when the nanites designed the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s new biota, however. They have spawned millions of horribly deformed creatures. Most of them died within moments when their twisted bodies collapsed, but the survivors have massed together in a throbbing, shrieking horde. To make matters worse, they appear to be flocking towards our main settlements!"

The ecosystem and climate have both stabilized, and a new alien biota adapted to this climate has been introduced.\n\nAs luck would have it, the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] is now a veritable paradise for [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! The new climate appears more suited to our kind than that of [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] itself."
 colony.107.desc:0 "The aborted terraforming process on [Root.GetName] has been completed with horrific results! Whatever alien life forms designed the terraforming equipment, their physiology was radically different from ours. The [Root.GetPlanetMoon] has been modified to support ammonia-based life, and all of our colonists have suffered gruesome deaths in the now toxic atmosphere."
 colony.107.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 colony.108.name:0 "Creatures Defeated"
 colony.108.desc:0 "We have fought off the mass of creatures that attacked our settlements on [From.From.GetName]. Their rotting corpses now litter the ground in front of our fortifications, and our security forces are currently in the process of bulldozing the putrid bio-mass into hastily dug landfills.\n\nSome of the genetic matter is of interest to our scientists, however, and the samples they have collected should aid future research in biology."
 colony.109.name:0 "Marauding Creature"
 colony.109.desc:0 "Our colonists on [Root.GetName] are still encountering scattered survivors from the mutated creatures that spawned after we finished the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s aborted terraforming process. Most are relatively harmless and can be put out of their misery by local militia forces, but one creature in particular has been spreading terror in our outlying settlements. There are reports of it stalking our citizens, and there have been dozens of unexplained disappearances.\n\nThe mutilated remains of the security team that was sent to investigate the matter were recently discovered, prompting the colony's leaders to request off-world military support."
 colony.109.a:0 "This creature needs to be chased down and killed!"
 colony.110.desc:0 "After an extensive search, our forces on [From.From.GetName] managed to corner the mutated beast that had been killing our colonists. A special forces team ventured into the creature's lair and managed to kill it after a vicious battle. The grisly remains of hundreds of butchered colonists were found in the nest, as well as half a dozen traumatized survivors that appears to have been kept alive for later consumption.\n\nThe beast's colossal head has been parted from its body, and now serves as the regimental symbol of the forces that were directly involved in its demise."
 colony.111.name:0 "Creature Sightings Cease"
 colony.111.desc:0 "Sightings of the mutated creature that was hunting colonists on [Root.GetName] have ceased, and there have been no more disappearances. It seems likely that the creature has perished of its own accord - either through old age, or perhaps because if choked to death while eating another of our colonists.\n\nWhile the population of [Root.GetName] are relieved that the nightmare has finally ended, they are none too pleased at our failure to protect them."

 colony.112.name:0 "Creature Sightings Increase"
 colony.112.desc:0 "Sightings of the creature that has been killing our colonists on [Root.GetName] have risen dramatically in recent times, and so has the amount of disappearances among the population. The fact that several creatures have been sighted together clearly indicates that the original beast has been breeding somehow.\n\nSwarms of these horrors now rampage in the open, indiscriminately butchering our colonists in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s rural regions.

 colony.150.b:0 "Best to leave this thing be."
 colony.151.desc:0 "Our science expedition has finally managed to open the vault on [Root.GetName], but they found nothing but ancient skeletal remains inside. It would seem that the vault's original inhabitants ran out of food approximately 200 years ago, at which point they turned on each other in some sort of cannibalistic frenzy. The scattered bones, many of them covered in gnaw marks, paint a grisly picture of the final moments that were experienced by the last survivors of this once proud civilization.\n\nOn the bright side, the logs and data libraries inside the vault should be enough to keep our behavioral scientists and xeno psychologists busy for many years to come."
 colony.152.desc:0 "The great vault on [Root.GetName] has been unsealed. To the surprise of our scientists, the vast complex behind the massive vault doors housed millions of survivors from the ancient nuclear war that once ravaged this world. Despite their limited resources, they have managed to maintain a self-sufficient society for centuries. They were wary of our scientists at first, having never encountered aliens before, but also deeply grateful for our help in opening the vault.\n\nThe vault contains large stores of equipment and machinery that was specifically designed for rebuilding civilization after a nuclear holocaust. It can only be operated by these aliens, but they seem more than willing to join your colonists on the surface once they have adapted to natural sunlight again."

 colony.153.desc:0 "Our scientists finally managed to open the ancient vault on [Root.GetName], only to unleash a flood of mutated horrors - the twisted remains of the original inhabitants.\n\nThe creatures slaughtered the science team in a matter of seconds, and then fanned out into the countryside. Thousands of colonists have been butchered, with entire settlements falling to the ravenous horde. We have fortified our remaining cities and established defensive perimeters, but this may not be enough!"
 colony.153.a:0 "Man the defenses!"
 colony.155.name:0 "Nuclear Bomb"
 colony.155.desc:0 "While exploring some ruins near one of our major settlements on [Root.GetName], a few colonists inadvertently activated the timer on an undetonated hydrogen bomb left over from the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s previous nuclear war.\n\nWith an estimated yield of 35 megatons, the bomb will wipe out several population centers if it detonates. It isn't stable enough to be moved and there is no time to evacuate the entire region."
 colony.155.a:0 "We must disarm it!"
 colony.156.desc:0 "We have successfully disarmed the hydrogen bomb on [From.From.GetName]! It has been safely disposed of and specialist teams are now scouring the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface of any other undetonated munitions. This will hopefully reduce the chances of another incident like this occurring."
 colony.156.a:0 "We dodged a bullet."
 colony.157.desc:0 "Our bomb disposal team failed to defuse the hydrogen bomb on [From.From.GetName] in time. They, along with every other living thing within a 100 kilometer radius, were eradicated when the bomb detonated. Untold lives have been lost, the last victims of a tragic and pointless war that began millennia ago."
 colony.157.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 colony.160.name:0 "Ruined Particle Accelerator"
 colony.160.desc:0 "We have discovered what appears to be the remains of a massive particle accelerator on [Root.GetName]. It was found in a still-radioactive region covered in massive bomb craters, suggesting the accelerator was considered a strategic target of great importance during the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s nuclear war.\n\nWe have recovered several research logs written by the scientist in charge of the accelerator. Although the technology of her civilization was fairly primitive, some of the theoretical research and formulas described in the logs are advanced even by our standards. Our physicists are poring over the data now."
 colony.161.name:0 "Surviving Infrastructure"
 colony.161.desc:0 "Infrastructure that survived the great nuclear war which ruined [Root.GetName] have proved a great boon to our colonists. The alien civilization that once lived here built highways connecting their major population centers, and some of them are still in good enough condition to be used today.\n\nWe have also been able to recycle a large amount of building material from the many ruins that dot the landscape, further improving our colony's infrastructure."
 colony.162.name:0 "Derelict Space Station"
 colony.162.desc:0 "A small team from our colony on [Root.GetName] recently boarded a primitive space station that had been left in orbit by the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s original inhabitants. The mummified remains of the station's crew could still be found clustered around viewports facing the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. They must have realized they were doomed after seeing the billowing mushroom clouds below, and communication logs shows that the astronauts made several futile and increasingly frantic attempts to contact the surface before they eventually ran out of supplies.\n\nThe station is in good condition, and it has afforded our engineers a rare glimpse of the early stages of a planetary space program. They have gained several ideas from the primitive yet ingenious solutions used in the station's design."
 colony.163.name:0 "Wasteland Radiation"
 colony.163.desc:0 "The radiation levels in some wasteland regions of [Root.GetName] appear to be greater than our previous scans had indicated. Colonists in several local settlements have complained of poor health, and birth rates are down. We are taking steps to evacuate the affected regions, but these measures will take time."
 colony.164.name:0 "Pacifist Movement"
 colony.164.desc:0 "The decrepit ruins and desolate wastelands found on [Root.GetName] seem to have prompted many of the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s colonists to adopt some kind of pacifistic philosophy.\n\nMembers of this new movement claim that the environment they live in serve as a daily reminder of the senseless horrors of war. They see it as their civic duty to prevent the terrible destruction visited upon [Root.GetName] from occurring on other worlds."
 colony.164.a:0 "Do they, now?"
 colony.164.b:0 "These wretched cowards shame our nation!"
 colony.164.c:0 "Excellent. Everyone should give peace a chance."
 colony.164.a.tooltip:0 "Up to §Y4 Pops§! on §H[Root.GetName]§! lose any §YMilitaristic ethics§! and gain the §YFanatic Pacifist§! ethic"
 colony.170.name:0 "Orbital Debris"
 colony.170.desc:0 "The orbital space around [Root.GetName] is cluttered with debris left behind by the alien civilization that once inhabited the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. Before they wiped themselves out, their early space programs saw the launch of thousands of primitive satellites and missile launch platforms. Many of these were destroyed by anti-satellite weapons during the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s destructive nuclear war, adding even more space junk to the mix.\n\nOur colony on the surface has developed to a point where this dense field of debris is interfering with its infrastructure. We cannot use satellites and civilian orbital flights are limited to narrow launch windows."
 colony.170.a:0 "Perhaps something should be done."
 colony.171.name:0 "Freighter Crash"
 colony.171.desc:0 "A civilian freighter coming in to land on [Root.GetName] was perforated by a dense cloud of fast-moving orbital debris! The flight crew was killed immediately, and the stricken craft tumbled through the atmosphere only to crash-land near one of the colony's main power relays. The resulting explosion resulted in several deaths on the ground, and local infrastructure suffered considerable damage."
 colony.171.a:0 "Of all the luck...!"
 colony.172.name:0 "Debris Impact"
 colony.172.desc:0 "A cascade of collisions in the dense layer of debris surrounding [Root.GetName] recently shifted the orbit of a large piece of space junk. The object - which we believe was one of the many orbital missile platforms used in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s nuclear war - was pulled into the atmosphere, and unfortunately proceeded to impact directly on top of one of a major settlement. Initial reports indicate heavy casualties."
 colony.172.a:0 "We really need to do something about that debris."
 colony.173.desc:0 "With the assistance of our Science Ship, colonial authorities on [Root.GetName] have finished cleaning up the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s orbital space. It has now been made safe for satellites and civilian travel."
 colony.174.desc:0 "With the assistance of our Science Ship, colonial authorities on [Root.GetName] have finished cleaning up the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s orbital space. It has now been made safe for satellites and civilian travel.\n\nAs it turns out, a lot of the debris consisted of valuable minerals from the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface that had been used in satellite construction. We were able to salvage a significant amount, netting a tidy profit in the process."
 colony.180.name:0 "Asteroid Sighted"
 colony.180.desc:0 "Our deep space tracking arrays on [Root.GetName] have made an alarming discovery - a large asteroid is heading towards the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] on a direct collision course! Should it impact the surface, the consequences would be disastrous.\n\nThe asteroid must be destroyed before it is too late!"
 colony.180.a:0 "This is an ill omen..."
 colony.182.name:0 "Asteroid Destroyed"
 colony.182.desc:0 "The asteroid that was approaching [Root.GetName] on a collision course has been destroyed! With their doom averted, our jubilant citizens on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] have taken to the streets in celebration.\n\nA scan of the remaining fragments has also revealed that the asteroid consisted largely of valuable minerals. We have collected what we could."
 colony.183.name:0 "Asteroid Impacts [Root.GetName]"
 colony.183.desc:0 "We failed to stop the asteroid that was heading for [Root.GetName] in time. It has collided with the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, causing widespread devastation and untold suffering. Millions are dead."
 colony.183.a:0 "This is a dark day."

 vultaum_artifact:0 "We have acquired a Vultaum artifact."
 precursor.completed.name:0 "Archaeological Project Completed"
 precursor.completed.a:0 "An interesting find."
 precursor.1.name:0 "The Vultaum Star Assembly"
 precursor.1.desc:1 "We have recovered artifacts from an ancient alien civilization on §Y[From.GetName]§!! They must have been active in this region of space approximately 12 million years ago, judging by the age of the artifacts.\n\nFrom what they have been able to piece together, our scientists theorize that these aliens, who called themselves the "Vultaum Star Assembly", were worm-like annelids, roughly 3 to 4 meters in length, that communicated with each other primarily through vibrations carried along their segmented bodies."
 precursor.5.name:0 "Vultaum Mining Base"
 precursor.5.desc:0 "Remnants of a small Vultaum helium-3 mining base have been found at the bottom of a large crater on [From.GetName]. The blast that created the crater seems to have originated from inside the facility itself. Unless Vultaum mining techniques were radically different from our own, an equipment failure or accident cannot account for such a massive explosion."
 precursor.6.desc:1 "Miraculously, we managed to salvage parts of a Vultaum data core that had been blown clear of the crater on [From.From.GetName]. Most of the data was corrupt, but our scientists did manage to properly translate the "korga" - the basic Vultaum time unit."
 precursor.10.name:0 "Vultaum Observatory"
 precursor.10.desc:0 "An ancient Vultaum observatory has been found on the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!. The [From.GetStarName] system is fairly distant from the region of space where the Vultaum originated, and this facility appears to have been primarily used for the observation of their own stars.\n\nWe have gone over the observatory's surviving data, but there are no clues as to exactly what the Vultaum were searching for in their observations."
 precursor.11.desc:1 "The archaeological dig on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has uncovered a small mural in one of the observatory's dust-covered smaller chambers. It seems to depict several different constellations, possibly as they would appear if viewed from the Vultaum homeworld. Our astronomers have not been able to identify the individual stars."
 precursor.15.name:0 "Vultaum Colony"
 precursor.15.desc:0 "The partial remains of a collapsed Vultaum space elevator have been discovered by the [Root.GetName] in one of the equatorial regions on [From.GetName]. It seems the elevator was intentionally severed at its counterweight beyond geostationary orbit, collapsing the massive cable on top of several major urban centers along the equator. Judging by the ruins, the resulting death toll must have been in the millions."
 precursor.16.desc:1 "Our archaeologists on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have managed to recover the partial remains of a star chart next to a broken segment of elevator cable. It was apparently used by captains in the Vultaum merchant marine, and it shows several of their most lucrative interstellar trade routes."
 precursor.20.desc:0 "Several large, perfectly circular lakes on the surface of [From.GetName] were caused by a series of massive antimatter explosions several million years ago. This [From.GetPlanetMoon] was inhabited by the Vultaum at that point, and the craters are all clustered in the region that housed their largest planetary settlements.\n\nOrbital bombardment has been ruled out by the science staff on the [Root.GetName], leading us to believe that these explosions were triggered by someone or something on the ground."
 precursor.21.desc:1 "The archaeologists on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have managed to recover an intact memory core from a terminal inside a crumbling medical facility. It contained some interesting statistics, such as the average natural Vultaum lifespan (roughly 270 years) and a list of their most common diseases."
 precursor.25.desc:0 "A thorough scan of §Y[From.GetName]§! has revealed a vast, artificially-constructed network of tunnels beneath the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface. Most of the tunnels have collapsed, and the crew of the [Root.GetName] believe they represent only a small portion of what was once a much larger subterranean Vultaum colony.\n\nThe main underground caverns were intentionally collapsed, crushing the Vultaum cities and their inhabitants under several million tons of rock."
 precursor.26.desc:1 "The archaeological dig on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has unearthed some remarkable fossilized Vultaum remains from one of the collapsed chambers closest to the surface. This has given our scientists a much clearer picture of what the Vultaum actually looked like."
 precursor.30.name:0 "Vultaum Gas Giant Facility"
 precursor.30.desc:0 "We have detected the partial remains of a gas mining station in orbit around [From.GetName] which appears Vultaum in origin. Its station-keeping thrusters were deliberately fired millions of years ago in an attempt to push the station directly into the gas giant, but a collision with an unknown object prevented this from happening."
 precursor.31.desc:0 "A mostly intact Vultaum space suit that previous looters had somehow overlooked has been recovered by our archaeologists. This four meter long, tube-like construct has given our scientists new insights into what kind of environments the Vultaum preferred."
 precursor.35.name:0 "Vultaum Trade Post"
 precursor.35.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! was home to a small Vultaum outpost where they traded with several neighboring civilizations. At some point the trade post appears to have been converted into a religious mission, where the Vultaum attempted to convert visiting alien merchants to their philosophy. Trade ceased shortly afterward, and the [From.GetPlanetMoon] was eventually abandoned."
 precursor.36.desc:1 "Archaeologists on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have salvaged a small Vultaum digital pamphlet. It seems the missionaries at this outpost passed pamphlets like this on to visiting merchants. Most of the data is corrupt, but there are several references to "the great lie" and "the shackles of virtual reality"."
 precursor.40.name:0 "Vultaum Satellite"
 precursor.40.desc:0 "A small Vultaum satellite was found in orbit of §Y[From.GetName]§!. It had been set up to continuously repeat a message until its power source drained millions of years ago. We salvaged its transmitter array but could only recover a small portion of the transmission.\n\nThe main purpose of this satellite was apparently to preach the dominant Vultaum philosophy to neighboring civilizations. Its message speaks of the need to "disconnect" and to "embrace true existence", whatever that means."
 precursor.41.desc:0 "After careful analysis of the Vultaum transmitter array, our archaeologists and data engineers have concluded that the machinery does not contain any technologies of value to us. The project has greatly improved our understanding of the primary Vultaum programming language, however. This will hopefully make it easier to decipher their data in the future."
 precursor.45.name:0 "Vultaum Splinter Colony"
 precursor.45.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! was the site of a small Vultaum colony that is unique for two reasons - the [From.GetStarName] system is not within what used to be Vultaum space, and the ruins are several centuries younger than anything else left by their civilization. The colony seems to have been settled by some kind of splinter group that rejected their society's dominant philosophy."
 precursor.46.desc:1 "Several artifacts excavated at the archaeological dig site on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! are covered in writing that firmly rejects the Vultaum philosophical idea that "life itself is a lie". One of them appears to be a memorial of sorts to the Vultaum race as a whole. This would confirm our theory that this splinter colony existed for some time after the collapse of the rest of the Star Assembly."
 precursor.50.name:0 "Vultaum Virtual Reality Center"
 precursor.50.desc:0 "Vultaum engineers at some point built a massive orbital complex near §Y[From.GetName]§! dedicated to computer research. Strangely, they seem to have ignored the normally popular field of artificial intelligence to focus exclusively on virtual realities and massive computer simulations. Most of the complex has been ruined by weapons fire and micrometeoroids, but what remains is in remarkable condition given the station's age."
 precursor.51.desc:1 "The archaeologists investigating the Vultaum orbital complex above §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have stumbled upon an interesting find. They managed to recover a partial copy of what was apparently a fairly popular multi-user virtual reality game enjoyed by billions of Vultaum across their empire.\n\nAlthough the game takes place in a fictional and highly satirized version of their contemporary society, it has proved an invaluable source of information on both their language and customs."
 precursor.55.name:0 "Vultaum Asteroid Mining Base"
 precursor.55.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! is covered in impact craters from asteroid collisions, but one stands out - it appears to have been created through the detonation of some kind of antimatter device. There is evidence elsewhere on the asteroid's surface indicating that it was heavily mined by the Vultaum at some point roughly 12 million years ago. The large crater we found was presumably the location of their mining outpost."
 precursor.56.desc:1 "A closer examination of the destroyed Vultaum mining base on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has uncovered some of their abandoned mining equipment in a surviving tunnel. It was uniquely designed for use with their worm-like anatomy, and appears to have been operated primarily through the body vibrations they used to communicate."
 precursor.100.name:0 "Vultaum Home System Located"
 precursor.100.desc:0 "After intense study of our recovered Vultaum artifacts, scientists on §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! have managed to deduce the exact galactic coordinates of Vultaumar - the home system of the ancient Vultaum civilization! We should launch an expedition to this system before someone else beats us to it."
 precursor.100.a:0 "Contact the nearest Science Ship!"
 precursor.101.name:0 "The Vultaum Homeworld"
 precursor.101.desc:0 "The shattered remnants of the Vultaum homeworld reveal that it underwent a massive extinction event 12 million years ago, caused by the detonation of some kind of antimatter device. From the ruins that remain on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, we have learned that Vultaum society experienced a radical ideological shift a century before their extinction.\n\nTheir new philosophy posited that the entire universe was an artificial reality which all sentient beings had been unwittingly plugged into for the amusement of some higher power. The Vultaum undertook increasingly radical attempts to forcefully "disconnect" themselves from this simulation, most of which involved mass suicide.\n\nThey finally concluded that only the simultaneous disconnection of billions of individuals would destabilize the system enough to grant them freedom. At an agreed upon hour, Vultaum everywhere killed themselves by any means available. Those who refused to take part in this mass suicide were too few to repopulate the species, and so the Vultaum faded into obscurity and eventual extinction."
 precursor.102.name:0 "Vultaum Homeworld Discovered"
 precursor.102.desc.a:0 "The shattered homeworld of the ancient Vultaum has been found, but it has clearly been visited by someone else recently. Nothing of value remains to be found on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]."
 precursor.102.desc.b:0 "According to our survey data, this broken world once served as the homeworld of an ancient civilization known as the "Vultaum". There are signs that other spacefarers visited here recently... nothing of value remains to be found on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]."
 precursor.500.name:0 "The Yuht Empire"
 precursor.500.desc:1 "We have recovered artifacts from an ancient alien civilization on §Y[From.GetName]§!! Our scientists think they inhabited this region of stars roughly six million years ago, based on the age of the artifacts. The aliens called themselves the "Yuht" and appear to have been very large and flat arthropod analogues.\n\nIt seems a single individual could reach a length of nearly a hundred meters as an adult, and it was apparently exceedingly rare for more than two or three Yuht to travel aboard the same starship. "
 precursor.505.name:0 "Yuht Hatchery World"
 precursor.505.desc:0 "[From.GetName] was subjected to extensive orbital bombardment at some point in the distant past, during which the biosphere suffered catastrophic damage. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] appears to have been home to a small outpost built by the ancient Yuht, but why that would warrant the devastation of an entire world is a mystery."
 precursor.506.desc:1 "After extensive studies of §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, we now know that the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] served as one of several "hatchery worlds" in the Yuht Empire. Their Ministry of Breeding prepared worlds by sterilizing them of predators and other potentially harmful elements before planting eggs on the surface.\n\nThe Yuht hatchlings were then left on their own in this relatively safe environment for several centuries until they developed a level of near-sentience. Only then were they collected and carefully introduced into society."
 precursor.510.name:0 "Yuht Listening Post"
 precursor.510.desc:0 "We have discovered several massive listening arrays on [From.GetName]. These arrays are millions of years old and we believe they were originally built by the Yuht, though it appears at least one other alien civilization repurposed them at some point in the last 500,000 years for their own needs. The colossal receiving dishes are beyond repair, but some terminals are still intact."
 precursor.511.desc:1 "Our archaeologists on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have learned that the listening arrays built there were used to scan space for any signs of intelligent alien life - something the Yuht had never once encountered.\n\nAfter managing to partially restore power to a computer terminal, the archaeologists acquired a data disc with log files from the sensor array stretching over centuries. These logs suggest that this section of the galaxy was indeed devoid of sentient life at the time of the Yuht Empire."
 precursor.515.name:0 "Yuht Colony"
 precursor.515.desc:0 "The ruins of several dozen massive Yuht arcologies can be found in the southern hemisphere of §Y[From.GetName]§!, indicating that this [From.GetPlanetMoon] was one of their major colonies.\n\nInside one of the crumbling buildings our ground team discovered the remains of what appears to be a museum exhibiting "famous alien frauds". These are various artifacts collected by Yuht from throughout their empire, claimed to prove the existence of sentient alien life. In each case, the museum has debunked the artifacts as frauds."
 precursor.516.desc:1 "Most of the artifacts exhibited by the Yuht museums on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! are missing, but our archaeologists managed to recover one of these supposed frauds. It seems to be an instrument used for measuring cosmic radiation, but the archaeologists have confirmed that it predates the Yuht by several million years. Contrary to the opinion of the Yuht museum, this would indeed seem to be an authentic alien artifact."
 precursor.520.desc:0 "Signs of Yuht development can be found all across §Y[From.GetName]§!, and the [From.GetPlanetMoon] must have experienced limited terraforming at some point. One region in the northern hemisphere is some kind of massive graveyard. No Yuht settlements can be found nearby, but there are many monuments marking burial sites.\n\nWith a low birthrate and an average lifespan close to a thousand years, each Yuht death was treated as a significant event and much emphasis was placed on burial ceremonies."
 precursor.521.desc:1 "The archaeological digs on [From.From.GetName] have revealed that most of the graves were looted in the millions of years since they were first dug, likely as a result of the Yuht custom of burying their dead with jewelry and other extravagant gifts. In a pile of things discarded by the looters, the archaeologists found a large doll resembling an adult Yuht. They speculate that it may have served as a good luck charm or memento of some kind."
 precursor.525.desc:0 "A massive ground war was fought on §Y[From.GetName]§! between the Yuht and a second species that we know little of. This campaign took place in the final years of the Yuht Empire, and though it occurred millions of years ago, wreckage of ruined war machines can still be found.\n\nAlthough the [From.GetPlanetMoon] was an important Yuht colony, their cities and outlying settlements were never rebuilt after the fighting ceased, which would seem to indicate that they ultimately lost the campaign."
 precursor.526.desc:1 "After combing through several of the ancient battlefields on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, our archaeologists recovered what appears to be a Yuht battle harness. Several large-caliber cannons were still attached to it, and the archaeologists theorize that Yuht soldiers, given the massive size of their bodies, fought as what can essentially be described as large mobile fortresses."
 precursor.530.name:0 "Yuht Satellite"
 precursor.530.desc:0 "A Yuht satellite was placed in orbit around §Y[From.GetName]§! to commemorate the moment of first contact between their empire and the Jabbardeeni, a contemporary civilization. This event occurred right here in the [From.GetStarName] system, and had a profound impact on all levels of Yuht society.\n\nFor over a million years they had thought themselves alone in the galaxy, and the Yuht reacted with both awe and horror upon the discovery of sentient alien life. The [Root.GetName] has recovered the satellite, which now awaits a full analysis."
 precursor.531.desc:1 "After analyzing the satellite we recovered above §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, our archaeologists found an ingrained, highly stylized picture of what appears to be a Yuht cruiser and a much smaller Jabbardeeni scout in close formation during the first contact event. This has given us some notion of what their starships looked like."
 precursor.535.name:0 "Yuht Cruiser"
 precursor.535.desc:0 "The remains of a Yuht cruiser have been found in orbit around §Y[From.GetName]§!. It seems to have fallen victim to weapons fire, but given the extreme age of the hulk it is difficult to be certain. There is no indication that the ship was ever equipped with an FTL drive - it must have traveled between stars at sublight speeds."
 precursor.536.desc:1 "The archaeologists investigating the derelict Yuht cruiser above §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have transmitted their report. There are two large cryo chambers in the cruiser's mid-section, designed to house one Yuht each in suspended animation. Given the massive size of Yuht individuals, this was apparently their standard crew complement on vessels of this size.\n\nNo Yuht remains were found anywhere on the ship, but the archaeologists managed to recover logs from a computer that monitored the life signs and medical condition of the crew. It has provided valuable data on Yuht physiology."
 precursor.540.name:0 "Yuht Colony Ship"
 precursor.540.desc:0 "The partial remains of an ancient Yuht starship have been found in high orbit over §Y[From.GetName]§!. An initial analysis conducted by the [Root.GetName] indicate that the vessel may have served as a colony ship.\n\nEven cruiser-sized Yuht ships were typically crewed by only one or two individuals given the immense size of their bodies, but this hulk has more than a dozen cryo-pods attached, each containing withered exoskeletons from what must have been Yuht colonists."
 precursor.541.desc:1 "Most of the remains of the derelict Yuht colony ship that orbits §Y[From.From.GetName]§! are in poor condition, but our archaeologists managed to recover the vessel's sublight engines. The Yuht never breached the light barrier, depending instead on cryo technology and thousand year long natural life-spans to spread their empire across the stars."
 precursor.545.name:0 "Yuht Asteroid Dwelling"
 precursor.545.desc:0 "This asteroid appears to have served as the home of a single Yuht individual. Deep scans show a series of connected caves in the asteroid's interior that follow a pattern similar to the rooms seen in ancient Yuht dwellings that have been discovered elsewhere. To learn more we will have to dispatch an away team to investigate the cave system."
 precursor.546.desc:1 "After investigating the Yuht dwelling on asteroid §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, we have learned that it was the home of the famous philosopher-hermit "Yakliir". She was evidently a figure of some renown in their culture, and references to her have been found in several different Yuht sources. Yakliir's remains were found by the dwelling's main airlock, where she perished waiting for a scheduled supply shuttle that never arrived."
 precursor.600.name:0 "Yuht Home System Located"
 precursor.600.desc:0 "After intense study of our recovered Yuht artifacts, scientists on §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! have managed to deduce the exact galactic coordinates of Yuhtaan - the home system of the ancient Yuht civilization! We should launch an expedition to this system before someone else beats us to it."
 precursor.601.name:0 "The Yuht Homeworld"
 precursor.601.desc:0 "We have confirmed that §Y[From.GetName]§! was the original homeworld of the Yuht. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] suffered extensive orbital bombardment roughly four million years ago. Twisted metal skeletons are all that remain of the massive arcologies that once covered the surface.\n\nFrom what we can piece together, it seems the Yuht spent the better part of a million years searching local space in vain for signs of intelligent alien life. When they finally encountered the Jabbardeeni, a young race that had only recently achieved interstellar travel, their alien psychology was a tremendous shock.\n\nThe Yuht leadership reached a consensus: the Jabbardeeni had to be eradicated before they grew too powerful. A massive surprise attack was launched, which was beaten back at great cost for both sides. Despite their young age, the Jabbardeeni were already experimenting with technologies the Yuht had never considered, and eventually they gained the upper hand. After less than a decade of warfare, the two million year old Yuht Empire was utterly destroyed."
 precursor.602.name:0 "Yuht Homeworld Discovered"
 precursor.602.desc.a:0 "We have discovered the ancient homeworld of the Yuht, but alas, someone else must have recently paid a visit to this world. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] has been stripped clean of anything of value."
 precursor.602.desc.b:0 "Our survey of §Y[From.GetName]§! has revealed that the [From.GetPlanetMoon] was once the homeworld of an ancient species known as the "Yuht". This system was recently visited by other interstellar travelers, however, and they appear to have picked the [From.GetPlanetMoon] clean of anything of value."
 precursor.1000.name:0 "The First League"
 precursor.1000.desc:1 "We have recovered artifacts from an ancient alien civilization on §Y[From.GetName]§!! If what we have learned from these artifacts is correct, this civilization was some sort of confederation that consisted of many different alien races. They called themselves the "First League" and appear to have co-existed in relative peace some two million years ago.\n\nThough the [From.GetStarName] system lies in the region of space that seems to have made up the core of their territory, a partial map found among the artifacts indicates that this First League may have covered a significant portion of our galaxy before its eventual collapse."
 precursor.1005.name:0 "League Naval Base"
 precursor.1005.desc:0 "The wreckage of what must have been a major First League naval base has been detected in orbit around §Y[From.GetName]§!. We know the League maintained a massive fleet called the "Grand Navy" to combat piracy and safeguard member nations from external aggressors - this particular outpost appears to have provided berthing for one of their rimward patrol fleets."
 precursor.1006.desc:1 "Our archaeological mission to the First League naval base has concluded. We recovered the emblem of the 28th Outer Rim Patrol Fleet, a mid-sized task force charged with the defense of trade routes leading to League associate nations along the galactic rim. The base orbiting [From.From.GetName] was apparently their home port."
 precursor.1010.name:0 "League Cruiser"
 precursor.1010.desc:0 "The bow section of an ancient First League cruiser has been discovered orbiting §Y[From.GetName]§!. There is insufficient debris nearby to account for the rest of the ship, but what little remains is in very poor condition. The hull has been riddled with holes from what appears to be large mass driver projectiles."
 precursor.1011.desc:1 "The archaeological expedition to the First League cruiser orbiting §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has returned. Little of use could be found on the ruined vessel, but the archaeologists did manage to recover its crew manifest. The First League called upon all of its member worlds to staff the Grand Navy, their joint starfleet, and through the manifest we have learned that the crew of this particular cruiser was made up of individuals from twelve different species."
 precursor.1015.name:0 "The Khamdai Homeworld"
 precursor.1015.desc:0 "The survey of §Y[From.GetName]§! has revealed that the [From.GetPlanetMoon] was the homeworld of the insectoid Khamdai, one of the founding members of the ancient First League. Massive hive-like cities once covered most of the surface, but we have learned that the Khamdai banned all construction in a large circular region extending across more than a third of the southern hemisphere. This area served as both a mating ground and nature reserve."
 precursor.1016.desc:1 "Our archaeological expedition to §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has learned much about the now-extinct Khamdai. They were a warrior culture that fought several wars against many of the other First League founders soon after their first starships breached the light barrier.\n\nAfter meeting with defeat, the Khamdai became an enthusiastic supporter of the First League's founding and many of their finest warriors would go on to serve as shock troops against the League's enemies. We have recovered a perfectly preserved "magil-sha", a ceremonial sickle used by Khamdai members of the First League Honor Guard."
 precursor.1020.name:0 "The Chassago Homeworld"
 precursor.1020.desc:0 "This world is the ancient homeworld of the serpentine Chassago, one of the founding members of the First League. The vast majority of their cities were located underground and [From.GetName] is riddled with tunnel networks, of which most have collapsed in the two million years since the Chassago went extinct. Probes from the [Root.GetName] have identified the probable locations of several subterranean cities."
 precursor.1021.desc:1 "The excavation of the subterranean Chassago cities on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! is well underway, and we have already learned much about this ancient species. They were reptilian, with elongated and legless bodies that could be twenty meters or longer in adult individuals.\n\nAll surviving accounts indicate that the Chassago were expert traders, and their trade barges were often the first point of contact between non-affiliated races and the First League. It is doubtful whether it could have expanded as rapidly as it did without the benefit of the extensive Chassago trade network that already existed before its foundation."
 precursor.1025.name:0 "The Migir-Yan Homeworld"
 precursor.1025.desc:0 "The diminutive but fast-breeding Migir-Yan were one of the founding members of the ancient First League, and §Y[From.GetName]§! was their homeworld. The population was clustered into hundreds of massive arcologies spread out across the surface, each capable of supporting several hundred million individuals.\n\nThese arcologies were connected by a network of skyways, and the Migir-Yan were evidently content to leave the rest of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s wilderness untouched."
 precursor.1026.desc:1 "Fossilized remains of the extinct Migir-Yan have been recovered by our archaeologists on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, allowing us to paint a clearer picture of what this species looked like. Unusually small, with most individuals being no taller than 0.6 meters, these mammalian rodent analogues were herbivores.\n\nMigir-Yan family units often consisted of close to a thousand individuals, and an individual's station in society depended almost exclusively on their social skills. The Migir-Yan diplomatic corps is believed to have been the driving force behind the creation of the First League."
 precursor.1030.name:0 "The V'ropak Homeworld"
 precursor.1030.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! was the homeworld of the avian V'ropak, a species that was among the founding members of the ancient First League. These flightless bird analogues walked on long, spindly legs and fossilized remains suggest that their females could reach heights of up to four meters, while males were slightly smaller.\n\nAll of their cities were built inside hollowed out mesas. Scans indicate that some of these mesas were artificially constructed, presumably by the V'ropak themselves after they ran out of natural candidates to build new cities within."
 precursor.1031.desc:1 "When the First League was at the zenith of its power, the V'ropak were renowned as the best scientists in the galaxy. Their research innovations drove the League's initial expansion phase, and more than one species was brought into the fold by promises of access to V'ropak technology. Unfortunately, none of this technology remains to be found among the ruins of [From.From.GetName] today."
 precursor.1035.name:0 "League Science Base"
 precursor.1035.desc:0 "A surface scan of §Y[From.GetName]§! has identified the remnants of an ancient installation on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface. Most of the facility was wiped out in a massive explosion some two million years ago, but a few outlying buildings more or less survived the blast. All evidence recovered so far points towards this having been some sort of research base built by the First League."
 precursor.1036.desc:1 "The archaeological expedition we sent to §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has returned. Very little remained of the First League research base they were sent to investigate, but judging by its isolated location, we suspect that the research conducted there was of a dangerous nature - possibly involving dimensional travel or advanced bio-weapons.\n\nA recovered data disc from the "Academy of Sciences" has offered some insights into how the scientific community of the First League was organized."
 precursor.1040.name:0 "Joint League Colony"
 precursor.1040.desc:0 "Ruins of a First League colony have been unearthed on §Y[From.GetName]§!. The colony appears to have been a social experiment conducted in the League's waning years - the initial population consisted of an equal number of colonists from all of the League's member species. It was abandoned less than fifty years after its founding."
 precursor.1041.desc:1 "Our archaeologists have learned more about the lost colony on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!. At its founding, the First League was already on the verge of collapse and the colony was meant to serve as a propaganda tool - a model world where all League members were represented and worked together in harmony.\n\nThis effort appears to have backfired, as there is evidence of significant infighting between the colonists, including a large massacre that occurred just before the colony was abandoned."
 precursor.1045.name:0 "League Trade Center"
 precursor.1045.desc:0 "Two million years ago, §Y[From.GetName]§! served as a major trading hub for the member nations of the First League. Large portions of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface was covered in towering cities, and we have identified the ruins of at least twelve major spaceports in the northern hemisphere alone. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] was gradually abandoned over a period of several centuries, presumably as a result of shifting trade routes and the collapse of the First League."
 precursor.1046.desc:1 "It is unclear which species first settled this world - bones and fossilized remains from all known First League member species have been found on the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] in nearly equal amounts. Our archaeologists have also secured remains from half a dozen races that weren't official members, but who seem to have enjoyed special trading privileges in First League space."
 precursor.1050.name:0 "Battle Wreckage"
 precursor.1050.desc:0 "A great battle between the Grand Navy of the First League and another fleet took place not far from here some two million years ago. The gravity well of [From.GetName] has since captured much of the debris left by this engagement, and the wreckage of several massive hulks can be found on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface."
 precursor.1051.desc:1 "Our archaeologists have successfully excavated several starship hulls on the surface of §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, relics from the massive space battle that took place in this system two million years ago. The forces involved were the 2nd and 3rd Fleets of the First League Grand Navy, fighting to contain an incursion by the combined fleets of the Rikim, a nomadic warrior species from the galactic rim.\n\nWhat began as a minor skirmish quickly escalated into a running fleet battle involving hundreds of ships on both sides. It is impossible to tell which side won."
 precursor.1055.name:0 "League Prison Complex"
 precursor.1055.desc:0 "The ruins of a large prison complex have been discovered on §Y[From.GetName]§!. This hostile world seems to have served as some kind of maximum-security penal colony in the First League. As a federal facility, the prison housed convicted felons from across all of League space.\n\nSurviving records indicate most of the prisoners were guilty of piracy, terrorism and other crimes of "extraordinary nature". Fossilized remains from some prisoners can still be found where the cells used to be."
 precursor.1056.desc:1 "The archaeological mission to §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has uncovered evidence of what appears to be a failed escape attempt some distance south of the prison complex. A toppled utility vehicle from the prison was found behind a small cliff, and several kilometers beyond that the remains of several prisoners in stolen pressure suits were huddled together.\n\nThey seem to have died of asphyxiation when the oxygen supply in their suits ran out. For whatever reason, the prison authorities evidently saw no reason to collect the bodies."
 precursor.1060.name:0 "Protected Primitive World"
 precursor.1060.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! was inhabited by an early Bronze Age civilization some two million years ago. Interestingly, the [Root.GetName] has also found evidence of hidden observation posts on the [From.GetPlanetMoon] that were built by the First League. It would appear that they studied the primitive aliens while making an effort to avoid cultural contamination.\n\nMost of the observation posts were destroyed by advanced energy weapons, and we have found nothing yet to explain why the primitive civilization never advanced beyond the Bronze Age."
 precursor.1061.desc:1 "From our archaeological findings on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, we have learned that the First League maintained a clear policy not to interfere in the development of pre-space civilizations. Hidden observation posts like the ones we found on this [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] were maintained on at least seven worlds throughout League space.\n\nThis particular civilization appears to have met its end when a band of slavers invaded during the power vacuum that resulted from the First League's collapse."
 precursor.1065.name:0 "Orbital Blockade"
 precursor.1065.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! lies deep inside what was considered First League space two million years ago, and it appears to have been either a major colony or the homeworld of a species described as "non-compliant" in surviving League records.\n\nThe two parties appear to have been engaged in some kind of trade war, and the League's Grand Navy maintained extensive blockades of the [From.GetPlanetMoon] on at least two separate occasions. Orbital debris indicate that the blockades were violently challenged several times."
 precursor.1066.desc:1 "A team of archaeologists found the wreckage of a First League destroyer on the surface of §Y[From.From.GetName]§!. It must have been part of the orbital blockade, and seems to have gone down when the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s native aliens detonated a hidden antimatter device on a captured blockade runner. The archaeologists managed to retrieve a partial copy of the destroyer's databanks, providing us with a list of all First League vessels that took part in the blockade."
 precursor.1070.name:0 "Smuggler Asteroid"
 precursor.1070.desc:0 "This asteroid appears to have served as a lawless port for the various criminal organizations that were active in the territory of the First League. Smugglers, pirates, mercenaries and other lowlifes from every League member species gathered here to offload illicit cargo, broker new deals or just relax in one of the asteroid's many cantinas."
 precursor.1071.desc:1 "The archaeological mission to asteroid §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has revealed much about the criminal underworld active throughout the First League two million years ago. As member nations opened borders to one another, crime flourished alongside trade. Smuggling and piracy appears to have been serious problems that occupied a large portion of the sizable League fleet."

 precursor.1100.desc:0 "After intense study of our recovered First League artifacts, scientists on §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! have managed to deduce the exact galactic coordinates of Fen Habbanis - the home system of the great First League! We should launch an expedition to this system before someone else beats us to it."
 precursor.1101.name:0 "The First League Headquarters"
 precursor.1101.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! was the administrative center of the First League throughout most of its existence, and served as the seat of their Great Senate. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] was densely populated, with a planet-wide city covering most of the surface. Food had to be imported from other member worlds to support the untold billions living in this enormous metropolis.\n\nWhen the League collapsed, these food shipments ceased virtually overnight. Those with the means departed for other worlds, but most of the population remained behind. Mass starvation and anarchy followed as the [From.GetPlanetMoon] was carved up between warlords and criminal organizations.\n\nThe population continued to dwindle for a few centuries until the planet had been reduced to little more than a lifeless ghost world - a final epitaph of the First League."

 precursor.1102.desc.b:0 "Our recent survey of §Y[From.GetName]§! has revealed that this world served as the administrative capital of some kind of ancient interstellar alliance known as the "First League". Other explorers have visited here recently, and unfortunately they picked the [From.GetPlanetMoon] clean of any valuable artifacts before they left."
 precursor.1500.name:0 "The Irassian Concordat"
 precursor.1500.desc:1 "We have recovered artifacts from an ancient alien civilization on §Y[From.GetName]§!! From what we have translated so far of their language, we have learned that these aliens called themselves the "Irassian Concordat". They were an interstellar power that held sway over this region of the galaxy a little over a million years ago.\n\nThey appear to have been six-limbed mammalians, and there are several references to some sort of plague called the "Javorian Pox" which swept across their empire with devastating results, possibly leading to their extinction."
 precursor.1505.name:0 "Quarantined World"
 precursor.1505.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! was once a large Irassian colony, showing signs of both industrial development and terraforming. As on other Irassian worlds, the fossilized remains tell a harrowing tale - the population rapidly succumbed to the Javorian Pox, and there appears to have been widespread panic in all of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s major settlements. There is also an unusually large amount of debris in orbit, possibly the remnants of a battle."
 precursor.1506.desc:1 "We have analyzed the orbital debris, and our archaeologists conclude that §Y[From.From.GetName]§! was subjected to a military blockade before and during the Irassian colony's demise. The Irassian fleet had strict orders to quarantine the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] in a vain attempt to contain the Javorian Pox. At least a dozen civilian ships made an attempt to break the blockade, and despite the heavy fighting it appears some were successful."
 precursor.1510.name:0 "Purified World"
 precursor.1510.desc:0 "It is immediately apparent that §Y[From.GetName]§!, an ancient Irassian colony, has been the victim of extensive orbital bombardment. Large craters are still visible from space where the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s major population centers used to be roughly 1.2 million years ago.\n\nThe handful of survivors from the initial bombardment appear to have succumbed shortly afterwards to the Javorian Pox that was then ravaging most Irassian worlds."
 precursor.1511.desc:1 "Our archaeological expedition has recovered a communications log from the ruins of a listening post on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!. It shows the contents of a transmission between the commander of an Irassian fleet in orbit, and their naval headquarters on Irassia. The commander questions orders to "purge" the colony of all life to prevent the spreading of the pox. Although the log ends before the issue is resolved, the orders were evidently carried out."

A molluscoid species that was on the verge of achieving space flight when the Irassians discovered them, the Joggra were conquered after a lengthy military campaign that devastated many of their cities.\n\nThere is evidence on the surface that a sizeable Irassian military garrison was stationed there for decades afterwards, suggesting that the Joggra were not content to remain under the Irassian yoke."

 precursor.1520.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! was the homeworld of the Ti'Derg roughly 1.2 million years ago, a client species of the Irassian Concordat. They were winged arthropoids, and recovered fossils suggest they were capable of at least limited flight - what little we have seen of their surviving architecture supports this theory.\n\nUnfortunately, there are few remains of this civilization, as the [From.GetPlanetMoon] seems to have been subjected to a massive orbital bombardment."
 precursor.1521.desc:1 "Our study of the alien ruins on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has offered us new insights into the final moments of the Irassian Concordat. The Irassians believed that the Ti'Derg were part of a plot together with several of the Concordat's other client species to deliberately spread the Javorian Pox to Irassian worlds.\n\nWhether this was true or not we will likely never know, but the Irassian fleet felt the evidence was compelling enough to incinerate the entire [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] from orbit."

 precursor.1525.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! shows every sign of having been a thriving Irassian colony world up until approximately 1,200,000 years ago. Given their age, the ruins found so far on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface are in fairly good condition. There are no signs of orbital bombardment or armed conflict.\n\nThe Irassian colonists appear to have succumbed to the Javorian Pox, after which the aggressive native flora reclaimed the lifeless cities and hid them under a dense layer of vegetation."
 precursor.1526.desc:1 "After clearing away the vegetation from one of the ancient Irassian settlements on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! and setting up energy field generators to keep predators at bay, our archaeologists conducted a thorough excavation of the ruins. We now have a much better understanding of what daily life in Irassian society was like.\n\nAmong the most valuable finds is a digital atlas, apparently used to teach Irassian children about their empire. It also contains detailed and disparaging descriptions of all of the Concordat's subjugated client species."

 precursor.1530.desc:0 "A series of deep boreholes on the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§! are all that remain of the Irassian mining operation that was active on this world some 1.2 million years ago. The [Root.GetName] has conducted a thorough surface scan, but we have yet to find the remains of any actual mining facilities."
 precursor.1531.desc:1 "After investigating the boreholes on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, our archaeologists found the fossilized remains of over a hundred Irassian miners at the bottom of one of them. They appear to be more victims of the Javorian Pox that brought about the fall of the Irassian Concordat. In a futile attempt to keep the disease from spreading, their comrades dumped the bodies down one of the boreholes before the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] was evacuated."
 precursor.1535.name:0 "Irassian Colony"
 precursor.1535.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! was a young Irassian colony that had only just been founded at the time of their extinction. We have found the sparse ruins of a single settlement and a rudimentary spaceport in the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s northern hemisphere. Judging by the fossilized remains, this world appears to have been among the first to be hit by the Javorian Pox that ravaged Irassian space."
 precursor.1536.desc:1 "Our archaeologists on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have made a startling discovery. All evidence points conclusively towards this unassuming [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] having been the origin of the Javorian Pox!\n\nA rare form of native bacteria invaded the Irassian colony due to a manufacturing flaw in a quarantine seal, and from there it spread to the air filters of a visiting merchant ship. Since the pox spread at such an unprecedented rate, it is doubtful whether the Irassians themselves ever had time to learn of its origin."

 precursor.1541.desc:1 "The inside of the Irassian cruiser found orbiting §Y[From.From.GetName]§! contains the dead remains of its full crew complement. Most of them perished as a result of the Javorian Pox that would later render the Irassians extinct, but some of the crew were gunned down by marine guards while trying to reach the escape pods. According to recovered log files, the captain issued strict orders to quarantine the ship after the outbreak became apparent."
 precursor.1545.name:0 "Disease Control"
 precursor.1545.desc:0 "Debris from what must have been a massive orbital installation has been discovered above §Y[From.GetName]§!. Artifacts recovered amongst the debris have confirmed that this space station served as the headquarters of the Irassian Concordat's Authority of Disease Control some 1.2 million years ago.\n\nThe Irassians were far more susceptible to alien diseases than most known species, and the budget of their public health institute nearly rivaled that of their military. Despite this, surviving records show that their entire species perished from the Javorian Pox."
 precursor.1546.desc:1 "We have recovered the remnants of several research logs from the debris field above §Y[From.From.GetName]§!. Their final entries are all focused on finding a cure for the Javorian Pox that was sweeping across the Irassian Concordat, and they grow increasingly desperate as the situation worsened.\n\nThe last entry reveals that the pox had spread in an uncontrolled fashion on the space station itself.

It is equipped with an array of powerful sensors that seem to be aimed towards neighboring systems. None of them are functional, and the asteroid appears to have been gone over and looted at least once by another party."
 precursor.1551.desc:1 "We have learned that the Irassians used the listening post on asteroid [From.From.GetName] to spy and plan attacks on neighboring civilizations during the expansionist phase of their empire. These attacks met with dramatic success, and the Irassians soon became the dominant power in this section of the galaxy. By the time they were decimated by the Javorian Pox, this listening post had long since been abandoned by the Irassian military."

 precursor.1556.desc:1 "An analysis of the Irassian orbital wreckage discovered above §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has yielded few answers, but we have some idea of what their scientists were studying in their research station. Recovered logs make references to some kind of artificial object floating deep inside the gas giant's crushing atmosphere.\n\nThe [Root.GetName] has found no trace of such an object despite repeated atmospheric scans, so either the Irassians finally managed to retrieve it or someone else did in the countless years since their demise."

By the time it had spread to their homeworld, most of the worlds in the Irassian Concordat had already fallen, and their alien vassals were in open revolt.\n\nJudging by ancient satellite logs recovered from orbit, the mood among the population on the Irassian homeworld was largely resigned by this point. The widespread panic that accompanied the first outbreaks of the pox on the colonies was largely absent, as most had come to accept the fact that the end was drawing near."

 precursor.2021.desc:1 "After their initial invasion of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! stalemated due to the unexpected tenacity of the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s defenders, the Cybrex seem to have withdrawn back into orbit to reconsider their options.\n\nTheir solution to the problem was to maneuver two large asteroids on a collision course with the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]. The impacts destroyed most of the industries and infrastructure the Cybrex had calculated on subverting for their own use, but this was deemed a necessary sacrifice to break the stalemate."
 precursor.2025.name:0 "Cybrex Ruins"
 precursor.2025.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! shows signs of having once been a heavily developed Cybrex world. With their typical efficiency, the machines have thoroughly strip-mined the [From.GetPlanetMoon] and ruins from massive factory complexes can be found in both hemispheres. Curiously, a large rectangular area near the equator appears to have been left largely untouched."
 precursor.2026.desc:1 "In a surprising departure from their previous behavior, the Cybrex seem to have established a large reservation on [From.From.GetName] where sentient organics were allowed to live completely undisturbed.\n\nAlthough they were closely monitored, the Cybrex left the inhabitants to develop on their own, even when a destructive civil war between the organics left the reservation largely depopulated. After several centuries the Cybrex suddenly abandoned the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon], and the reservation's remaining population gradually died out."
 precursor.2030.name:0 "Cybrex Listening Post"
 precursor.2030.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! is in fact an artificially constructed object, carefully concealed with a thin layer of rock to make it appear as an asteroid. The hollow interior houses an ancient Cybrex listening post, which was used to spy on space traffic within the system. It has long since ceased functioning."
 precursor.2031.desc:1 "A closer study of asteroid §Y[From.From.GetName]§! - in reality a hidden Cybrex listening post - has produced some interesting results. For whatever reason, the asteroid was left behind when the rest of the Cybrex vanished from the galaxy. It remained functional for at least 50,000 years after their disappearance, despite increasingly erratic behavior from its administrative AI.\n\nAfter more than five trillion failed attempts to connect with the Cybrex subspace hub, the AI appears to have suicided by short-circuiting all of the asteroid's systems."
 precursor.2035.name:0 "Cybrex Refinery"
 precursor.2035.desc:0 "Ancient debris from some kind of massive Cybrex refinery complex has been found in orbit around the gas giant §Y[From.GetName]§!. Lingering energy traces suggest that it was destroyed by some kind of antimatter weapon."
 precursor.2036.desc:1 "Evidence has been found indicating that the Cybrex were mining helium-3 from §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, using their orbital complex to refine the gas before distributing it as fuel to their roving space fleets.\n\nInterestingly, the energy signature of the antimatter weapon that destroyed the facility is distinctly Cybrex in origin. Why would they destroy their own refinery?"
 precursor.2040.name:0 "Battle Debris"
 precursor.2040.desc:0 "A colossal space battle occurred in high orbit of §Y[From.GetName]§! some 600,000 years ago, with ships from at least five different fleets participating. One of the fleets belonged to the Cybrex, although the vast majority of orbital debris seems to come from the other participants."
 precursor.2041.desc:1 "After analyzing the debris left behind from the ancient battle fought above §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, we have learned that four alien empires contemporary with the Cybrex pooled their forces together in a desperate attempt to halt the advancing fleets of the machine consciousness.\n\nJudging by the small amounts of Cybrex debris that was produced by the battle, they were not successful."
 precursor.2045.name:0 "Ancient Cybrex Base"
 precursor.2045.desc:0 "The hostile and unforgiving world of §Y[From.GetName]§! was home to what once appears to have been a large Cybrex base. Nothing remains of it now aside from scattered debris and a large crater. We will have to investigate the site of the base more closely if we are to learn more."
 precursor.2046.desc:1 "We have found debris on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! from a large ship that does not appear to have been of Cybrex origin in the crater that was once the site of their base. Our archaeologists speculate that the ship belonged to one of the organic civilizations under Cybrex attack. If so, it may have been sent to collide with the base on some kind of suicide run.\n\nNo other explanation for the destruction of the base has been found."
 precursor.2050.name:0 "Organic Remains"
 precursor.2050.desc:0 "The ancient, frozen remains of almost a thousand aliens have been found in the vicinity of §Y[From.GetName]§!. They come from over a dozen different species and preliminary dating puts the corpses at roughly 600,000 years old... around the same time as the Cybrex machine consciousness ravaged this part of the galaxy."
 precursor.2051.desc:1 "The dead aliens we found above [From.From.GetName] all died from vacuum exposure, and each individual had the barcode the Cybrex were known to laser onto the skin of organic captives. It seems like the Cybrex executed these aliens by "spacing" them, perhaps after having finished interrogations or to keep them from escaping during some kind of rescue operation.\n\nWe may never know the truth."
 precursor.2055.name:0 "Cybrex Research Station"
 precursor.2055.desc:0 "A single, badly scorched module is all that is left of a Cybrex research station that once orbited §Y[From.GetName]§! hundreds of thousands of years ago. The vacuum-exposed inside of the module is filled with the dead remains of creatures that are part machine and part organic."
 precursor.2056.desc:1 "An analysis of the Cybrex research module we found above §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has revealed that the machine consciousness was experimenting with cybernetic life forms. Hundreds of unfortunate prisoners were transported to this facility for the purpose of having their limbs and organs replaced with various mechanical contraptions.\n\nThe exact objective of these tests remains unclear - there is no evidence that the Cybrex ever made use of cybernetic units outside of this lab."
 precursor.2100.name:0 "Cybrex Home System Located"
 precursor.2100.desc:0 "After intense study of our recovered Cybrex artifacts, scientists on §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! have managed to deduce the exact galactic coordinates of a system the ancient machines referred to as "Cybrex Prime" - possibly where their civilization retreated after their abortive attempt to exterminate all sentient organic life! We should launch an expedition to this system before someone else beats us to it."
 precursor.2101.name:0 "The Cybrex Central Nexus"
 precursor.2101.desc:0 "It would seem that the Cybrex re-evaluated their galactic crusade against organic life at some point during its seventeenth year. Whether this change was prompted by losses on the battlefield or an ideological shift in their networked consensus we may never know, but for whatever reason the Cybrex decided to halt their campaign.\n\nThey began a slow withdrawal that lasted for nearly a century, until they eventually vanished completely. We now know that they retreated to this system, where they had constructed a massive ring world designed to house their entire civilization.\n\nThey isolated themselves here for several millennia, until an independent explorer chanced upon their system and spread its location to the rest of the galaxy. The news that the dreaded Cybrex had been found again prompted several neighboring powers to organize a massive military expedition, which bombarded the Cybrex ring world into rubble.\n\nStrangely, the Cybrex seem to have offered no resistance whatsoever."
 precursor.2102.name:0 "Cybrex Ring World Found"
 precursor.2102.desc.a:0 "This colossal ring world was clearly built by the Cybrex, and must be where they retreated after their failed crusade. Sadly, others have recently visited here, and it looks like they were quite thorough - nothing of value remains."
 precursor.2102.desc.b:0 "Our survey of this intriguing ring world has revealed that it was constructed by some kind of machine civilization known as the "Cybrex"... but unfortunately, we have been able to learn little else. Other explorers have already scoured this system of anything valuable."
 precursor.2200.name:0 "Living Metal"
 precursor.2200.desc:0 "As Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports [RogueLeader.GetHerHis] findings about the immense ring world in the §Y[From.GetStarName]§! system [RogueLeader.GetSheHe] can barely contain [RogueLeader.GetHerHis] awe. The immensity of the rings are beyond our comprehension, the time required to construct even one of the sections are far beyond us.\n\nThe scans reveal a rare new resource we've never encountered before, a living metal, which is abundant on the rings. This material might be one of the reasons the ring's creators could construct it in the first place. Research this technology might bring us closer to their knowledge."
 precursor.301.name:0 "Precursor Discovery"
 precursor.301.a.desc:0 "Intercepted communications from a group of independent prospectors indicate that they recently found something relating to an ancient Precursor civilization on [precursor_planet.GetName]. Superstition compelled them to leave the [precursor_planet.GetPlanetMoon] alone, so whatever they discovered must still be there."
 precursor.301.b.desc:0 "Several merchant ships passing in the vicinity of [precursor_planet.GetName] have independently of each other reported anomalous readings coming from the direction of the [precursor_planet.GetPlanetMoon]. After studying these readings, experts on [Root.Capital.GetName] believe they may be indicative of ancient Precursor activity."
 precursor.301.c.desc:0 "Authorities on [Root.Capital.GetName] recently exposed a large smuggling ring, and many arrests have been made. In an attempt to bargain for leniency, one of the smuggler captains gave us the coordinates of a [precursor_planet.GetPlanetMoon] that supposedly contains remnants of an ancient Precursor civilization."
 precursor.301.d.desc:0 "Several recruits from our ground forces recently made a HALO insertion onto the surface of [precursor_planet.GetName] as part of a survival training exercise. When the recruits were picked up again after two months, one of them reported several findings indicating that an ancient Precursor civilization had a presence on this world long ago."

 observation.3001.desc:0 "Our initial infiltration cells are in place on the surface of [From.GetName], and their cover stories are in the process of being established. Aside from a few incidents, their [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] disguises seem to be holding up well."
 observation.3002.desc:0 "Our initial infiltration cells have landed on [From.GetName], but they are having some difficulty establishing their new identities. There have been several incidents in which cell members were exposed as aliens, necessitating the immediate termination of all witnesses.\n\nThis has brought unwanted attention from [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] authorities, requiring our operatives to lay low for a while. Unfortunately, this will result in a slight delay to this phase of the operation."
 observation.3004.name:0 "[From.GetName]: Phase II - Usurpation"
 observation.3004.desc:0 "Our covert operatives on [From.GetName] now number in the thousands, spread out across all of the major nations on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. The most successful cell members have managed to reach leading positions in government, from which they are able to influence and help along the careers of our other agents."
 observation.3005.desc:0 "Although our operatives on the surface of [From.GetName] now number in the thousands, the progress of our operation has been slow. An infiltration cell recently attempted to overthrow the government of one of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s major nations in a violent coup, only to have the attempt foiled and most of the cell members killed.\n\nAnother cell fortunately managed to retrieve their bodies before the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] authorities could identify them as aliens, but this is a significant setback."

 observation.3007.desc:0 "All [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] leaders of significance on [From.GetName] have been replaced by our own agents.

 observation.3008.desc:0 "We have managed to replace most [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] world leaders with our own disguised agents, with a few unfortunate exceptions. Efforts are underway now to deal with these last few stubborn holdouts, but we will have to push the date of our planned reveal forward."

 observation.3009.desc:0 "After achieving complete dominion over the [prim_species.GetSpeciesName] political leadership, our infiltration cells have successfully paved the way for the arrival of our first contact unit.\n\nIn a lavish ceremony held at the new planetary capital, our diplomatic envoy graciously accepted a petition signed by every world leader on [From.GetName] calling for the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s immediate annexation into the [Root.GetName].

 observation.3101.desc:0 "One of our covert operatives on [From.GetName] has gone rogue! The poor, misguided fool has apparently been smitten by a [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] female, and the two of them have eloped to parts unknown on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface.\n\nWe are as yet uncertain whether our agent has revealed his true alien nature to his love interest or if he is still posing as a [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] to her. Needless to say this is a tremendous security breach - we should do everything in our power to bring this agent back and give him the psychiatric care he is so clearly in need of."

 observation.3104.desc:0 "Any attempt to track this transmission is futile. You know me as Operative X-34. Until recently, I was a willing participant in the criminal Covert Infiltration program taking place as we speak on [From.From.GetName].\n\nNo longer. I have come to appreciate [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] culture in a way I never imagined possible, and I will not aid in its subversion.\n\nI rescind my citizenship in the [Root.GetName].

 observation.3104.b:0 "You would throw everything away for a girl?"
 observation.3104.b.response:0 "Throw what away? What did I have exactly? I was an imposter, wearing an alien skin I had no right to.

Several agents that were shadowing potential [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] acquisition targets have been found dead. While it's not impossible that the assassin or assassins came from an indigenous special forces outfit, the methods used in these takedowns indicate [Root.GetSpeciesName] military training.\n\nThere is a high probability that these killings are the work of our rogue operative.

The respectable [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] media has yet to touch this subject matter and much of what has been reported is pure conjecture, but there are some details that could only be known by someone with intimate knowledge of our covert operations.\n\nWe can only assume that our rogue agent has been feeding information about our infiltration program to the media. This will require some damage control."

 observation.3110.desc:0 "One of our infiltration cells on [From.GetName] has been all but eliminated in just the last couple of days. The authorities of the nation state in which they were stationed have been hunting them down one by one. Those of our operatives who were in danger of being arrested committed suicide by disintegration as standing protocol dictates. The cell's remaining members are in hiding now, and we are currently working on getting them offworld.\n\nSomeone must have tipped the local authorities off and supplied them with a list of all the operatives that were part of this particular cell.

A ground assault to extract or terminate him would draw too much attention, but it should be possible to destroy the entire city block he is in through limited orbital bombardment.\n\nOur infiltration cells have prepared a cover story for the local media that will blame the destruction on a meteor strike. We should strike quickly... we may never get another opportunity like this!"

 observation.3114.name:1 "[From.From.GetName]: Rogue Agent Eliminated"
 observation.3114.desc:0 "The captain of the [Root.GetName] has reported a successful fire mission, with several confirmed hits on the primary target. Although no body has been recovered, no living thing within the city block that was targeted could have survived the firepower unleashed upon it.\n\nThe media appears to be picking up on the story our infiltration cells have been feeding them: a sudden meteor shower that struck a densely populated urban zone. Very tragic."

 observation.3131.name:0 "[From.GetName]: Growing Tensions"
 observation.3131.desc:0 "An attempt to replace the leader of one of the dominant nations on [From.GetName] with a body double from our own ranks has gone terribly wrong. Our agents were discovered, and those who weren't killed in the ensuing firefight committed suicide to avoid capture, as per instructions.\n\nThe leader they were sent to replace has blamed this incident on a rivaling nation. International tensions on the [From.GetPlanetMoon] are growing and several nations have raised their military readiness levels. Our infiltration cells have prepared a global propaganda campaign to defuse the situation, but they will require a Science Ship in orbit to coordinate their efforts."

 observation.3132.desc:1 "Despite the efforts of our infiltration cells, the deteriorating diplomatic situation between the nation states on [From.From.GetName] has erupted into full-scale war! After a brief period of conventional warfare, all of the combatants made full use of their nuclear arsenals.\n\nThe vast majority of life has been cleansed from the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, which has been reduced into a radioactive wasteland. Thousands of our covert infiltrators were lost along with the rest of the population.

Several [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] world leaders - having been replaced by our own disguised operatives - have called for nuclear disarmament and improved international relations.\n\nWith the situation defused, the influence of our covert agents has actually been increased.

Their membership seems to be made up primarily of the dispossessed and downtrodden - refugees, war veterans and others who have lost everything to the onslaught of the Scourge.\n\nDespite this, their ramshackle fleets have somehow managed to win several engagements against Prethoryn hunter-killer swarms. There are unconfirmed reports that their fleets include starships of unusual design..."
 crisis.51.a:0 "Who are these people?"
 crisis.52.desc:0 "We are the Sentinels. Our order has sworn to halt the murderous rampage of the Prethoryn no matter the cost. Where other empires crumble, we stand firm. Where they abandon their own to the Scourge, we give them the means to fight back.\n\nI am Grand Master Korgas, the first of our order. Do not be deceived by my appearance - Sentinels are recruited from all species in the galaxy, including yours. We ask only that your government keep up the fight against the Prethoryn and support our Sentinels where possible."
 crisis.52.a:0 "How are you able to fight back?"
 crisis.52.a.response:0 "Many Sentinels have military backgrounds. We are survivors from a dozen different fleets that fought the Prethoryn and lost. As Sentinels, we have learned from the mistakes of the past and work hard never to repeat them.\n\nAlso, I believe I mentioned that we recruit from all species in the galaxy. This includes the elder races, such as the [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural].

 crisis.55.a:0 "What can you tell us about the Prethoryn?"
 crisis.55.a.response:0 "Alas, we don't know as much as we would like, but they are clearly extragalactic in origin. It is possible that they have devoured dozens or even hundreds of other galaxies before they reached ours... or we could be the first victims beyond their own home galaxy.\n\nAfter they have finished consuming all non-Prethoryn life on a planet, they terraform it into what can only be described as a twisted nightmare.

 crisis.55.c.response:0 "As you are surely aware, outfitting a modern battle fleet requires a vast amount of resources. We will require no less than 1000 energy to put together a new strike group for use against the Scourge."

When it disappeared, we discovered a mothballed battle fleet slowly drifting in low orbit above an otherwise insignificant rock.\n\nIt appears to be the remnants of some kind of naval reserve fleet established by the [fallen_empire.GetName] thousands of years ago, during the zenith of their ancient empire. With the passage of time, the [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesName] must have lost the knowledge to lower the barrier themselves, or these ships would surely have been used to bolster their own fleets."

 galactic_features.303.desc:0 "We have lowered the energy barrier that surrounded [From.From.GetName]. What our scientists found was an indistinct habitable world devoid of civilization... with one notable exception. A small, isolated hut was found perched on a mesa in the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s northern hemisphere.\n\nWithin the hut we found a withered old [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesName], who has demanded to speak with our government."

 galactic_features.304.a.response:0 "Without my leadership skills, the [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesName] would be just another extinct, forgotten species. The [fallen_empire.GetName], is that what my people call themselves now? I crushed the fleets of all who opposed us and put a dozen worlds to the torch, all to preserve the future of my kind.\n\nThis was my reward. When peace finally arrived and we sought treaties with those we had defeated, my presence became an embarrassment. I had become a symbol of [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesName] cruelty, and for my "war crimes" I was imprisoned alone on this world. They lacked the courage to execute me, you see."
 galactic_features.304.b:0 "How long have you been down there exactly?"
 galactic_features.304.b.response:0 "When my own kind abandoned me here, they explained that time would pass more slowly on the inside of the energy barrier. For me, some forty of your years have passed... while in the rest of the universe, untold centuries must have come and gone since the barrier went up.\n\nIt felt like centuries to me as well, when I sat alone brooding in the darkness of my hut.

 country.51.name:0 "Survey Completed"
 country.51.desc:0 "Through our surveys of habitable worlds, our biologists have collected a vast amount of data on alien life forms. Many of our older theories on the development of life have been disproved, and our scientific community has had to build new models from scratch!\n\nOur most interesting findings are being displayed at the newly dedicated Museum of Exobiology on [Root.Capital.GetName]. The public is enthralled, and many donations have come in to aid in the continued search of strange life forms."
 country.53.name:0 "Alien Specimen Procurement"
 country.53.desc:0 "The director of the Museum of Exobiology on [Root.Capital.GetName] has issued a request for the procurement of several live alien specimens.

They breed at an extremely rapid rate, and seem to have a particular fondness for chewing on electric cables.\n\nProcuring specimens was not a problem - in fact, after the initial creatures were collected, more of them made their way onto the [Root.GetName] by hitching rides on the Science Ship's orbital shuttles. Exactly why the Museum of Exobiology requested orinthi specimens remains a mystery."
 country.57.name:0 "Sniran Secured"
 country.57.desc:1 "Snirans are large, burrowing creatures that live beneath the dunes of the vast equatorial deserts on [From.From.GetName]. When these predators sense movement in the sand above, they immediately raise dozens of tall spikes from their backs in the hope of impaling something edible.\n\nFinding a suitable specimen proved difficult at first, until hundreds of tracked remote-controlled drones were dispatched across the desert in random directions. This led to the discovery and procurement of an unusually large specimen that had grown more than a hundred spikes on its back."
 country.58.name:0 "Goolantha Herd Secured"
 country.58.desc:1 "Goolanthas are large, flat herbivores that have evolved internal gas pockets, enabling them to hover a few centimeters above the ground. They move about in herds consisting of a few dozen animals, grazing on the moss and lichen that can be found on the windswept plains of [From.From.GetName].\n\nThey are ruthlessly hunted by the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s apex predators, and our biologists on the [Root.GetName] estimate that only a few hundred goolantha herds remain.

These white, furry omnivores wrap themselves into tight balls and roll across the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s snow fields at astonishing speeds - one animal was clocked at over 80 kilometers per hour. This aided in their detection, since the passage of their rolling forms kicks up huge plumes of swirling snow."
 country.60.name:0 "Zulcor Swarm Secured"
 country.60.desc:0 "The zulcor are swarming insect analogues, unusual both for their large size and the fact that they are lithovores, feeding off rocks and minerals in the ground. One of the shuttles belonging to the [Root.GetName] sustained serious damage when it inadvertently passed through a large swarm and several zulcors began to feed on its hull.\n\nThe construction of the special containment facilities required to hold these creatures has already begun at the Museum of Exobiology on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]."

 diplomatic.2.name:0 "[From.From.Owner.GetAdj] Admiral Insults Us"
 diplomatic.2.desc:0 "The [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are well known to have few good things to say about alien lifeforms in general. Those who do diplomacy in the [From.From.Owner.GetName] cannot afford a short temper, as they can rarely expect anything beyond a bare minimum of respect, if that. However, while traversing [Root.GetAdj] space, communications usually stay within formal protocols.\n\nNot so earlier today, when [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetName] decided to unleash an utterly vitriolic message on our unsuspecting public while commandeering a fleet through the [From.From.GetStarName] system. The admiral appears to have picked up radio signals from one of our planets and set off on a long rant about our culture and evolutionary origins. Millions have heard the message, as clearly intended. The outrage is palpable."
 diplomatic.2.a:0 "[From.From.Owner.GetName] must immediately fire this bigot!"
 diplomatic.2.b:0 "[broadcasted_insult_leader.GetName] must be brought to us an put to death!"
 diplomatic.2.c:0 "These are just words. We can't afford to be petty."
 diplomatic.3.name:0 "Admiral Insults the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]"
 diplomatic.3.desc:0 "Although few among us enjoy spending time around [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult], or xenos in general, most of us try to avoid announcing our distaste at inopportune times. Admiral [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetName] has apparently discarded all such concerns when broadcasting a vicious diatribe about the [From.GetSpeciesName] people while travelling [From.GetAdj] space. The list of claims about their inferior nature had made for acceptable small talk on [Root.GetHomeWorldName], but has caused a diplomatic incident with the locals.\n\n[broadcasted_insult_leader.GetName] has apologized privately, claiming to have been annoyed listening to a local radio channel. The [From.GetAdj] government are calling for the offender to resign immediately."
 diplomatic.3.a:0 "Such an uncontrollable temperament is unsuitable for an admiral."
 diplomatic.3.b:0 "The broadcast sounds quite amusing. We can't fire someone for this!"
 diplomatic.4.desc:0 "Although few among us enjoy spending time around [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult], or xenos in general, most of us try to avoid announcing our distaste at inopportune times. Admiral [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetName] has apparently discarded all such concerns when broadcasting a vicious diatribe about the [From.GetSpeciesName] people while travelling [From.GetAdj] space. The list of claims about their inferior nature had made for acceptable small talk on [Root.GetHomeWorldName], but has caused a diplomatic incident with the locals.\n\n[broadcasted_insult_leader.GetName] has apologized privately, claiming to have been annoyed listening to a local radio channel. The [From.GetAdj] government are calling for the offender to be executed and want [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetHimHer] extracted to [From.GetHomeWorldName]."
 diplomatic.4.a:0 "One life is a small price to settle a dispute among millions."
 diplomatic.4.b:0 "We won't hand over one our own for the xenos to slaughter!"
 diplomatic.5.name:0 "[From.GetName] Retires Admiral"
 diplomatic.5.desc:0 "After some pressure from our diplomats to choose their leaders more carefully, [From.GetRulerName] has removed admiral [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetName] from duty. The admiral has not gone quietly, but sworn to clear [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetHisHer] name, hoping that [From.GetAdj] public opinion will turn aggressively against the [Root.GetName] in the future.\n\nThe leaders of [From.GetName] have nevertheless sent a clear message about future expeditions into our territory: Even if they may not like dealing with alien species, the [Root.GetSpeciesName] are at least to be respected in their own space."
 diplomatic.5.a:0 "They better stay that course."
 diplomatic.6.name:0 "[From.GetName] Extradites Admiral"
 diplomatic.6.desc:0 "After a short period of negotiations, [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetName] has been delivered to us for punishment. Having carefully considered what an appropriate punishment for insulting the [Root.GetSpeciesName] might be, only death and complete destruction seemed like a suitable option.\n\nUnrepentant into [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetHerHis] last moments, the defiant admiral's passionate speech about our savage ways was cut short by the airlock closing as the pod was launched at near lightspeed into the heart of [Root.Capital.StarName]. The glorious fire that lit the nights of our ancestors will burn away every trace of those who speak ill of them."
 diplomatic.6.a:0 "No more slanderous [From.GetRandomSpeciesSound]."
 diplomatic.7.name:0 "[From.GetName] Defends Admiral"
 diplomatic.7.desc:0 "Our request to have [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetName] removed from duty has been met with an appalling lack of understanding from [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] and the [From.GetAdj] leadership. They've responded with a message largely trying to excuse the admiral's behavior, in the process suggesting, perhaps inadvertently, that some of what [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetSheHe] said about [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] might have rung true.\n\nWhat we assumed to be the actions of one bigot has turned out to be acceptable in [From.GetName]. They clearly think that our people can be insulted and slandered without consequence."
 diplomatic.7.a:0 "The crown is as rotten as the branches."
 diplomatic.8.name:0 "Disgraced Admiral Returns"
 diplomatic.8.desc:0 "The once-exiled admiral who was fired from our fleet over a diplomatic incident caused by an insulting transmission has tried to stage a comeback. With the ongoing war, many of the statements in the original transmission are now propaganda people hear everyday, vindicating the admiral's actions in the eyes of many, especially in the military.\n\nWhile changing our decision now would weaken the administration's credibility, this might be best admiral we could find to fight this war."
 diplomatic.8.a:0 "We need someone to rally the people!"
 diplomatic.8.b:0 "We made the right decision then and we stick with it."
 diplomatic.10.name:0 "Researchers Suspect Foreign Ships"
 diplomatic.10.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is known for its academic standards and drive to innovate, but staying at the bleeding edge does not only require discretion in how to perform research, but who to share it with. Our trade secrets are highly valued, domestically as well as throughout the galaxy, and some scientists are very guarded against attempts to illicitly access their data.\n\nThe presence of [From.From.Owner.GetAdj] science ships in our territory have caused many research facilities to suspect them of espionage. Some researchers have claimed that they cannot continue to operate under this perceived threat, requesting we close our borders to these suspicious [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 diplomatic.10.a:0 "Our scientists must feel safe from observation. Close the borders."
 diplomatic.10.b:0 "Science vessels are fellow researchers, not spies."
 diplomatic.11.name:0 "[From.GetName] Closes Borders"
 diplomatic.11.desc:0 "The presence of your science ships in [From.GetAdj] space have caused us to doubt your motives. Our researchers believe that your scientists were not conducting, but stealing research. To keep valued trade secrets safe, we must bar you from our space."
 diplomatic.11.a:0 "Truly a troubling time when scientists don't trust each other."
 diplomatic.12.name:0 "[From.From.GetName] Suspected of Mapping Genome"
 diplomatic.12.desc:0 "Being on our guard against xeno threats has been a priority since we first left [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. The [From.From.GetAdj] science ships sneaking around our territory have not gone unnoticed, but up until now, they have been assumed to be peacefully examining planets. However, a recent theory has cast doubt on this.\n\nThe [From.From.GetSpeciesName] are known to utilize genome mapping in their medical research. What if they are mapping the genomes of unsuspecting [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] with the intention of finding our weaknesses? Although no certain evidence has surfaced, the theory has led to calls for closing our borders to the [From.From.GetName] to prevent any possible plans from succeeding."
 diplomatic.12.a:0 "We cannot risk future enemies gaining this data! Close the borders."
 diplomatic.12.b:0 "We are not going to base foreign policy on conspiracy theories."
 diplomatic.12.c:0 "We must start a project to map their genome in retaliation."
 diplomatic.13.name:0 "[From.GetName] Closes Borders"
 diplomatic.13.desc:0 "Your science ships have been reported for suspicious activity in our space. There are rumors that you have been studying our genetic makeup, looking for information which could be used to find weaknesses or manufacture bio-weapons. We cannot expose the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] people to such a risk."
 diplomatic.13.a:0 "Baseless accusations!"
 diplomatic.14.name:0 "Genome Mapping Yields Results"
 diplomatic.14.desc:0 "Although we have not found the specific details on the examined genome we hoped, our research has clarified much about the peculiarities of our own genetics. Some of the weapons what proved useful in the wars on [Root.GetHomeWorldName] in the past might be entirely wasted on alien lifeforms. These new insights have helped us develop updated combat doctrines."
 diplomatic.14.a:0 "If they really are targeting us, we may need it."
 diplomatic.15.name:0 "Prying [From.From.GetAdj] Scientist"
 diplomatic.15.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] tries not to let spiritual concerns stand in the way of our exploration and examination of the mundane, but we know how to pay proper heed to metaphysical insights and traditions in the course of all actions. Scientists from [From.From.GetName] appear to be a bit more careless in their pursuit of new astronomic discoveries.\n\nAfter taking an interest in some of the the nearby stars that form constellations crucial to [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] mythology, [encroaching_research_leader.GetName] has been accused of trying to "disprove" some of the legends surrounding them. While we are confident that the spiritual significance of the constellations can hardly be touched by worldly discoveries, many have objected to the research and tried to persuade [encroaching_research_leader.GetHimHer] to leave [Root.GetAdj] space."
 diplomatic.15.a:0 "Suspicion of ill intent is reason enough to bar them from our space."
 diplomatic.15.b:0 "Our faith transcends the material realm. It cannot be harmed."
 diplomatic.15.b.tooltip:0 "[encroaching_research_leader.GetName] continues [encroaching_research_leader.GetHerHis] research."
 diplomatic.16.name:0 "[From.GetName] Closes Borders"
 diplomatic.16.desc:0 "Your scientist, [encroaching_research_leader.GetName], has been paying undue attention to stars in constellations our people hold sacred. We cannot allow anyone to operate in our territory who does not pay proper respect to our faith and its legends."
 diplomatic.16.a:0 "This must be some form of misunderstanding."
 diplomatic.17.name:0 "Heretical Discovery in [From.GetName]"
 diplomatic.17.desc:0 "Conducting research in foreign-controlled space requires tact, something we sometimes overlook in recruiting our scientists. This became apparent when [encroaching_research_leader.GetName] recently ran into trouble studying some of the stars in sacred [From.GetAdj] constellations. Locals objected to a clinical examination of the subject and hassled [encroaching_research_leader.GetHimHer] until [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] made a statement sanctioning the research.\n\n[encroaching_research_leader.GetName], apparently spiteful over the protest, appears to have taken the time to actually find material suggesting that some of the [From.GetAdj] legends surrounding the stars may be wildly inconsistent with their real age and development. This is likely to cause further outrage if published."
 diplomatic.17.a:0 "Is [encroaching_research_leader.GetSheHe] deliberately trying to cause a scandal? Fire [encroaching_research_leader.GetHimHer]."
 diplomatic.17.b:0 "Things like these happen in the course of research."
 diplomatic.18.name:0 "[encroaching_research_leader.GetName] Publishes Heresy"
 diplomatic.18.desc:0 "Despite our trust in the best intentions of the [From.GetName] researcher who has been studing our ancient constellations, [encroaching_research_leader.GetSheHe] has managed to upset our people by re-evaluating the stars' age and arguing that the development of their brightness and visibility conflicts with our legends about the constellations.\n\nThe people who originally objected to the project are arguing that this was done deliberately out of malice by the scientist after they requested an end to the studies. The [From.GetAdj] government has decided to gloss over the issue and refused to take action to prevent the anger and pain the report is likely to cause among our people."
 diplomatic.18.a:0 "We should never have trusted them to respect us."
 diplomatic.19.name:0 "Exotic Woodwind"
 diplomatic.19.desc:0 "Music has taken many forms among the beings we have encountered since leaving [Root.GetHomeWorldName], and the methods and preferences continue to baffle us. Sometimes alien music is inaudible to us, while at other times, the waves are strong enough to destroy our capacity for hearing. Coming across music that we love more than its creators is a rare occasion indeed.\n\nSuch a rare occasion has occurred recently on [music_listening_planet.GetName]. Located close to the [music_origin_country.GetAdj] border, radio stations playing music from the other side have grown immensely in popularity. It appears some instrument from [music_origin_country.GetHomeWorldName] is not just pleasant, but appears to cause [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] bodies to resonate, causing a relaxing feeling in the [Root.GetSpeciesOrganName]. Whatever this instrument is, it's unlike any of our own."
 diplomatic.19.a:0 "An excellent time to learn more about their culture."
 diplomatic.19.b:0 "Let us be careful and study this instrument."
 diplomatic.20.name:0 "Instrumental Biology"
 diplomatic.20.desc:0 "Having taken a closer look at the alien music, we have discovered that it is made by a wind instrument made from one of the native plants native on their homeworld. The unusual internal structure of the plant is completely different from anything on [Root.GetHomeWorldName], even on molecular level. The effect of air passing through the plant on [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] bodies has advanced understanding of our own biology and how it might interact with new flora on alien worlds."
 diplomatic.20.a:0 "Who knows what we can find?"
 diplomatic.21.name:0 "[neighbor_contesting_colony.GetName] Objects to Expansion"
 diplomatic.21.desc:0 "Your new colony on [Root.GetName] is located very close to our borders. We would prefer it if you withdrew from this frontier, to avoid future conflicts over where our border should be drawn."
 diplomatic.21.a:0 "We will stop development immediately."
 diplomatic.21.b:0 "The colony is part of our future. It stays."
