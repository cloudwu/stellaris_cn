 ##THE WORLD IS BLEEDING
 strange_worlds.1.name: "The World is Bleeding"
 strange_worlds.1.desc: "The surface of §Y[Root.GetName]§! is exhibiting an unprecedented reaction to our construction efforts. An unidentified viscous substance is beginning to ooze out from the foundations of key installations.\n\nThe ooze is some kind of crimson liquid; gelatinous in appearance but extremely adhesive to the touch.\n\nOur [Owner.GetScientistPlural] are eager to study this discharge further. Currently it is a mere inconvenience, but it would be prudent to ensure the safety of our [Owner.GetColonistPlural]."

 strange_worlds.5.name: "Major Hemorrhaging"
 strange_worlds.5.desc: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! reports troubling developments regarding the strange crimson ooze.\n\nThe substance is becoming unmanageable, emerging at a greater rate throughout the afflicted areas.\n\nThe ooze is not without its benefits. As it coagulates, its adhesive properties become more pronounced, effectively forming a natural cement that can be used to supplement our construction efforts.\n\nWorryingly though, the substance proves nearly impossible to remove from any [Owner.GetColonistPlural] who come into contact with it. Attempting to treat and study those affected would allow us to gather more information but would slow construction progress."

 strange_worlds.5.a: "Treat and study the afflicted."
 strange_worlds.5.b: "Keep building."

 strange_worlds.15.name: "Mountain of Blood"
 strange_worlds.15.desc: "Construction on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has continued at an exceptional pace, but the emergence of the viscous substance is no longer limited to just the foundations of our installations.\n\nHemorrhaging fissures have been discovered in multiple locations. Initially only non-native objects to [Root.GetName] were being affected by the substance, but now it is spreading indiscriminately.\n\nThe material has now consumed a large portion of the surface of [Root.GetName] and is rapidly congealing into a thick mineral coagulate that has surrounded [Root.GetName].\n\nThrough costly trial and error, our engineers have found a way to mitigate further damage as well as efficiently harvest the substance. This was only possible at the expense of ceding significant ground to the ooze."
 strange_worlds.15.a: "An interesting development."

 strange_worlds.20.name: "Parasite"
 strange_worlds.20.desc: "After intense study and treatment of the afflicted workers on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, our scientists have isolated the root cause of the problem.\n\nWhat initially presented as a viscous gelatinous substance, is in fact a collection of parasitic microorganisms that form a symbiotic relationship with the planet. The parasites decompose organic matter beneath the crust of [Root.GetName] and recycle it into new material.\n\nThe disturbance caused by [Root.GetName]'s development disrupted their natural lifecycle, causing them to react to the foreign substances we introduced into their ecosystem.\n\nGiven more time, our science team is confident that we can find a way to work in harmony with these lifeforms, integrating their unique biology into [Root.GetName]'s production pipelines."
 strange_worlds.20.a: "Fascinating, continue."

 strange_worlds.25.desc: "Through extensive research, our scientists have engineered a variant species of the parasitic microorganisms on §Y[Root.GetName]§!. This mutation is designed to recognize our own materials as harmless additions to their natural ecology, enabling us to resume construction with no further issue.\n\nAfter introducing them into the planet's biosphere, our engineered parasites have successfully integrated with it.\n\nFurthermore, by repurposing the microorganisms' original decomposition effects, we have managed to harness the substance's adhesive properties to boost our planet's production processes."

 strange_worlds.30.desc: "As we were preparing land for future expansion on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, a large structure seemingly blinked into existence.\n\nThe structure is emitting highly unstable energy waves causing it to intermittently appear and disappear from view. This explains why it was not present in initial scans of this sector.\n\nWhen visible, unintelligible symbols adorn its sealed exterior, but match no known language in our records. \n\nNo apparent function can be discerned.

 strange_worlds.60.desc: "We have gained valuable insights on the suicidal fauna species on §Y[Root.GetName]§!.\n\nThese megafauna are functionally blind, using echolocation to see and identify one another. We suspect that our energy grids are emitting a frequency that is overwhelming their acute hearing, triggering this aggressive behavior toward our power stations.\n\nIn addition to this, we have learned that their unique digestive enzymes can act as a catalyst in metallurgic refining. Initial tests show potential in improving our alloy production.\n\nDespite these discoveries, we are still a long way off from resuming normal energy production. Our scientists continue to investigate the issue."

Rivers of fast-moving sand appear from nowhere before stopping as suddenly as they began. There are even reports of sand dunes moving laterally on a perfectly windless day.\n\nNo atmospheric or geological explanations for these events have thus far been identified.\n\nThese peculiar sands are causing us no direct harm, but they are interfering with our colony's operations.

The frequency regularly shifts in pitch and modulates in recurring patterns.\n\nWhile this 'singing sand' phenomenon can be attributed to known properties of free particles, the regularity of these modulations cannot be explained by friction alone.\n\nWe have also found a valley filled with dunes etched with strange symbols. These glyphs appear fleetingly in raised formations before dispersing almost instantaneously.\n\nWhat is animating the sand is unclear, but the consistent nature of the patterns suggest purpose or intent behind its behavior."
