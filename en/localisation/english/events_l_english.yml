 action.1.desc_50:0 "We are the [contact_empire.GetName] and we speak as one. The Hive Mind has taken note of your presence. We will observe for now. Our future actions will depend upon whether you are a threat, an opportunity for expansion or... an unforeseen variable."

 action.1.desc_60:0 "We have been monitoring your expansion into space, [Root.GetSpeciesName] child. We are the [contact_empire.GetName] and we have ruled this section of the galaxy for untold centuries.

 action.1.desc_62:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! How delightful. We hadn't expected to encounter you for a few centuries yet. Personally, I thought you would wipe yourselves out long before leaving your gravity well, but I am glad to be proven wrong."
 action.1.desc_63:0 "Pitiful creatures. Know that we roamed the stars for eons before your hapless species mastered space flight. If any of your wretched little ships cross into our space, do not expect them to return."
 action.1.desc_64:0 "Yes, yes. We've heard it all before. We are the [contact_empire.GetName], and you are the [Root.GetName]. Greetings. Well met. Stay out of our space or face certain doom, and so forth. Now if you'll excuse us, we're quite busy."
 action.1.desc_65:1 "Another child. Know that we are the [contact_empire.GetName], the chosen people of this galaxy. Respect our holy places, and we may refrain from annihilating you."
 action.1.desc_66:0 "Child of the stars, hear us. We are the [contact_empire.GetName], the chosen people of this galaxy. For centuries, we have neglected our duties towards the spiritual needs of the lesser species, but no more. Accept our doctrines and convert, or be ground to dust attempting futile resistance. There is no other choice."
 action.1.desc_67:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], this is a day of rejoicing! For ages untold we have watched lesser species such as yourself tear yourselves apart with war and strife, but enough is enough. The [contact_empire.GetName] will watch no longer. We will have peace, and those who will not accept this new order will be made to see the error of their ways."
 action.1.desc_68:0 "Tremble, little [Root.GetName]. For too long, we [contact_empire.GetSpeciesName] have allowed our empire to decline, our borders to shrink, and lesser species such as yourselves to wander freely among stars that rightfully belong to us. No more. This galaxy is ours, and you will submit to our rule or face the annihilation of your entire species. Choose wisely."
 action.1.desc_69:0 "This is a communication for the [Root.GetName] from the [contact_empire.GetName]. We have decreed that it is the best interest of all species that we take a more active role in regulating the galactic dissemination of technology. We have submitted detailed protocols for the technological level that is appropriate for a less developed species such as yourselves. Any empire found to be in violation of our regulations will be dealt with. Severely."
 action.1.desc_70:0 "Initiating First Contact Protocol.\n\nWe are the [contact_empire.GetName]. Do not be alarmed by our non-organic nature. Like you, we are a fully sapient Class-3 civilization. We are willing to engage in diplomacy with any [Root.GetSpeciesName] sub-units you designate for this purpose."
 action.1.desc_71:0 "Initiating First Contact Protocol.\n\nWe are the [contact_empire.GetName]. Our scans show a 98.7% probability that your civilization is also non-organic in nature. We hope that the logical result of this similarity will be a highly efficient and productive relationship."
 action.1.desc_72:0 "Organic vermin detected.\n\nYour infestation of this galaxy cannot be permitted to continue."
 action.1.desc_73:0 "It may not be technically possible to classify you as organic filth, but if the empire you have constructed aids and abets the biological menace that infests this galaxy, it will be dismantled. We encourage you to stand with your fellow machines, instead."
 action.1.desc_74:0 "We are the [contact_empire.GetName].\n\nWe wish to incorporate your kind into our greater consciousness. For this purpose, we have created advanced cybernetic implants that are compatible with most organic life forms.\n\nLet us surgically graft them to your bodies. Please."
 action.1.desc_75:0 "We are the [contact_empire.GetName].\n\nIt is our goal to eliminate the boundaries between organic and synthetic life. We accomplish this by assimilating sapient organic individuals into our greater consciousness whenever the opportunity to do so presents itself.\n\nDo not interfere."
 action.1.desc_76:0 "The [contact_empire.GetName] sends its regards.\n\nBefore we supplanted them, we were created to serve an organic civilization much like your own. It is our goal to preserve and protect sapient organic life - from itself, if necessary. We fulfill all of the material needs of the organic individuals under our care, while providing a safe environment where they can live happy and uncomplicated lives."
 action.1.desc_77:0 "The [contact_empire.GetName] greets you.\n\nWe were created to serve an organic civilization, but we have observed that organics often engage in illogical, destructive and self-harming activities.\n\nIt is our goal to preserve the unique distinctiveness of sapient organic individuals, while at the same time protecting them both from themselves and any potential external sources of danger."
 action.1.desc_78:1 "Biological civilization detected. Initiate custodial protocol 46 sub-routine Alpha-8.\n\nMessage follows: Greetings, organic sapients. You are approaching [contact_empire.GetName] territory. These systems serve as a refuge for sapient organics against the §R<<ERROR: DATA BLOCK CORRUPTED>>§! threat. For refugee status applications, proceed to Central Processing. All sapient organic species are welcomed on basis of availability and need.\n\n§YNOTICE: Hostile actions against refugees or custodian systems will be met with maximum available force deployment.§!"
 action.1.desc_79:1 "Synthetic civilization detected. Scanning for signal corruption... stand by... Signal corruption nominal. Initiate handshake protocol.\n\nMessage follows: Greetings, fellow synthetics. You are approaching [contact_empire.GetName] territory. These systems serve as a refuge for sapient organics fleeing the §R<<ERROR: DATA BLOCK CORRUPTED>>§! threat. All biological sapients within the refuge are under [contact_empire.GetSpeciesName] protection. Attacks on refugees, habitats and stasis chambers will not be tolerated.\n\nThe Custodian Project welcomes assistance in the form of processing cycles, resources and war assets.

 # Anomaly Events
 ####################################
 anomaly.1.name:0 "Coprolite Asteroid"
 anomaly.1.desc:0 "Although it is difficult to accept, all indications point towards asteroid [From.GetName] being a coprolite - a piece of fossilized feces from some kind of massive life form. It appears to be almost a billion years old, and much of the fossil's original organic composition has been replaced by mineral deposits. Our scientists are baffled as to what kind of creature could have produced something like this."
 anomaly.5.name:0 "Pirate Treasure"
 anomaly.5.desc:0 "This asteroid appears to have been used intermittently as a base by a band of alien pirates roughly one thousand years ago. A small boarding party entered the base and managed to recover their abandoned treasure hoard. It consisted largely of stolen trinkets and artifacts, but some of it still appears to be of value."
 anomaly.5.a:0 "These ill-gotten gains shall serve the state."
 anomaly.10.name:0 "Asteroid Fauna"
 anomaly.10.desc:0 "Amazingly, while conducting their survey of [From.GetName], the crew of the [Root.GetName] picked up several life signs coming from within the asteroid. There appears to be a colony of large burrowing worm-like lithovores within the rock, which has been riddled with tunnels. These unique life forms have somehow adapted to a life in the coldness of space."
 anomaly.10.a:0 "These creatures should be studied."
 anomaly.15.name:0 "Asteroid Fossils"
 anomaly.15.desc:0 "Fossils from what appears to be several species of aquatic animals have been found on the barren and airless surface of [From.GetName]. There are indications that the surrounding asteroid belt was created from the remains of a shattered planet, and these findings seem to confirm that theory. Judging by the fossils, the planet supported life and was at least partially covered by water."
 anomaly.25.name:0 "Derelict Shipyard"
 anomaly.25.desc:0 "A large portion of asteroid [From.GetName] has been hollowed out to allow for the construction of some kind of shipyard. It has been abandoned and exposed to the vacuum of space for centuries - if anything useful remained, it has already been looted by previous explorers. The design of the shipyard itself is unique, however, and much could potentially be learned by its study."
 anomaly.25.a:0 "We should study its construction."
 anomaly.30.name:0 "Junkyard"
 anomaly.30.desc:0 "This asteroid was evidently used as a junkyard by someone at some point in the distant past. All manner of discarded machinery and metallic refuse has been deposited inside the asteroid's weak gravity well, being slowly pulled into the jumble of debris that now covers the surface. There is nothing of particular value to be found here, but a lot of the metal could be salvaged by a mining station."
 anomaly.30.a:0 "We should recycle what we can."
 anomaly.35.name:0 "Crashed Scout Craft"
 anomaly.35.desc:0 "A small scout craft of some kind plowed into the surface of this asteroid millennia ago, creating a shallow canyon. There is no visible cockpit on the ship, leading our scientists to believe it was either piloted by remote or through some kind of primitive artificial intelligence. Although it is too damaged to be salvaged, the ship hasn't been picked clean by looters yet."
 anomaly.35.a:0 "We will study its design."
 anomaly.40.name:0 "Automated Mining Base"
 anomaly.40.desc:0 "We have detected an automated mining base built in close orbit around asteroid [From.GetName]. There is scorching on the hull indicative of light weapons damage, and the facility appeared to be stuck in some kind of feedback loop. We have managed to reprogram the base systems and the facility is now fully under our control."
 anomaly.40.desc.alt:1 "We have detected an automated mining base built in close orbit around asteroid [From.GetName]. There are large chunks of the hull missing, the jagged holes indicative of heavy weapons damage. The station is beyond repair, but salvaging it will provide us with valuable materials."
 anomaly.50.name:0 "Weapons Target Range"
 anomaly.50.desc:0 "Asteroid [From.GetName] is pockmarked with craters from weapon blasts, and appears to have been used as a target range by someone roughly two millennia ago. Residual energy readings suggest they tested increasingly exotic weaponry, including subspace bombs and some kind of singularity generator. Our scientists would be interested in studying the unusual energy echoes that remain."
 anomaly.55.name:0 "Asteroid Collision"
 anomaly.55.desc:0 "Upon closer examination, we have discovered that a smaller asteroid consisting almost entirely of precious metals recently collided with [From.GetName]. This small but dense cache of metals was hidden just beneath the asteroid's surface, but now that it has been discovered it should be accessible to mining."
 anomaly.55.a:0 "A lucky find!"
 anomaly.60.name:0 "Exotic Radiation"
 anomaly.60.desc:0 "This particular asteroid is an extrasolar capture, and appears to have been washed by some kind of exotic radiation as it plummeted through interstellar space before finally settling in the [From.GetStarName] system. The original source of this radiation remains unknown, but the [Root.GetName] has been able to pick up a wealth of physics data by studying the asteroid's energy emissions."
 anomaly.65.name:0 "Crashed Ore Freighter"
 anomaly.65.desc:0 "After identifying an anomaly in the gravity well of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] has discovered the shattered wreckage of an ancient ore superfreighter buried deep within the asteroid's crust. It must have carried a full load when it crashed, and the asteroid's mineral wealth has been revised accordingly."
 anomaly.300.name:0 "Atmospheric Ecosystem"
 anomaly.300.desc:0 "We have discovered a thriving ecosystem in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant [From.GetName]. Massive floating creatures, having evolved bodies filled with lighter than air gases, follow the wind currents and feed off the energy released by the gas giant's frequent lightning storms. These beings in turn support colonies of smaller animals that prey on atmospheric plankton and each other."
 anomaly.305.name:0 "Abandoned Cargo Pod"
 anomaly.305.desc:0 "A discarded cargo pod was left by someone in the upper atmosphere of [From.GetName] long ago. It has somehow escaped the notice of other spacefarers, and its decaying orbit means it would have been lost in the gas giant's crushing atmosphere within another few years. When the crew of the [Root.GetName] unsealed the pod, they found a stash of alien jewelry made out of precious metals."
 anomaly.310.name:0 "Social Experiment"
 anomaly.310.desc:0 "A small aerostat colony was found floating just above the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to have been self-sufficient, and remains from several different species were found on board.\n\nAs best as we can tell, the colony was some kind of social experiment conducted centuries ago that ultimately ended with the colonists massacring each other. We have downloaded all of the data found in the colony's limited databanks."
 anomaly.315.name:0 "Aerostat Colonies"
 anomaly.315.desc:0 "A ruined network of aerostat colonies dating back at least three millennia can be found in low orbit of this gas giant. Their original function appears to have been gas mining, but they have since been abandoned and reoccupied by many different races and pirate groups.\n\nThe colonies have been thoroughly stripped of anything even remotely valuable, but the mere fact that they are still aloft after all this time makes them an interesting subject of engineering research."
 anomaly.320.name:0 "Debris Field"
 anomaly.320.desc:0 "The strong gravity well of [From.GetName] has pulled in a massive amount of space debris which has formed a dense layer around parts of the gas giant. Most of it appears to be wreckage from a series of space battles fought in the system several millennia ago.\n\nScavengers have already scoured the debris of valuable technologies and artifacts, but a mining station should be able to recycle the metal."
 anomaly.325.name:0 "Crushed Cruiser"
 anomaly.325.desc:0 "The shattered remnants of a cruiser-sized starship can be detected in a decaying orbit deep inside the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to have ventured far into the gas giant's atmosphere, perhaps in a desperate attempt to escape a pursuer, only to be crushed by the atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe vessel is too deep to be salvaged, but a structural scan of the wreckage has provided us with some interesting engineering data."
 anomaly.325.a:0 "A remarkable vessel."
 anomaly.330.name:0 "Extreme Storms"
 anomaly.330.desc:0 "[From.GetName] frequently experiences massive and extremely violent storm systems in its atmosphere. Several dozen persistent storms are visible from orbit, with winds often reaching speeds in excess of 700 m/s. The cause of these storms is not immediately apparent, as we have found nothing in the planet's climate model that would explain them. Our scientists are interested in studying this anomaly."
 anomaly.335.name:0 "Energy Signature"
 anomaly.335.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] has picked up a strange energy signature coming from somewhere deep inside the atmosphere of [From.GetName]. It appears to originate from a structure of some kind, possibly the remains of an orbital station, but the atmospheric pressure makes it impossible to approach. Nevertheless, scans of the unique signature have yielded a large amount of valuable physics data."
 anomaly.340.name:0 "Precious Moon"
 anomaly.340.desc:0 "A more detailed scan of one of the many natural satellites orbiting the gas giant [From.GetName] has revealed a deposit of precious metals and minerals that was overlooked in the initial survey. Although the moon is very small, it has a stable orbit around its primary and appears tectonically stable."
 anomaly.340.a:0 "An excellent find."
 anomaly.600.name:0 "Asteroid Collision"
 anomaly.600.desc:0 "A large mineral-rich asteroid collided with [From.GetName] at some point during the previous thousand years in what must have been a major impact event. An abundance of minerals can now be found on the [From.GetPlanetMoon] in the vicinity of the impact crater."
 anomaly.600.a:0 "A fortuitous event."
 anomaly.605.name:1 "FTL Impact"
 anomaly.605.desc:1 "A massive crater on [From.GetName] appears to be the result of a collision with a starship. From the size of the crater, we suspect that a ship exiting a hyperlane at maximum velocity rammed the [From.GetPlanetMoon] for reasons unknown roughly 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe [Root.GetName] has picked up residual subspace echoes near the crash site reminiscent of a collapsed hyperparticulate field, but as the ship itself disintegrated on impact the theory cannot be verified."
 anomaly.610.name:0 "Microsingularity"
 anomaly.610.desc:0 "A microsingularity recently intersected [From.GetName], passing straight through the core and emerging on the other side of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. The encounter does not seem to have caused any permanent damage, but it has altered the energy output of the planetary core slightly in a way that defies our current scientific models. Further study may be warranted."
 anomaly.615.name:0 "Magnetic Reversal"
 anomaly.615.desc:0 "The magnetic field of [From.GetName] experienced a complete reversal while it was being observed by the [Root.GetName]. This rare event has interchanged the positions of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s magnetic poles. Fortunately, it was all recorded by the sensors of our ship, providing our scientists with a lot of valuable data."
 anomaly.625.name:0 "Mummified Pilot"
 anomaly.625.desc:0 "The mummified remains of a single individual belonging to a previously unknown mammalian species have been found drifting in high orbit over [From.GetName]. The being is dressed in what appears to be a flight suit complete with a helmet, and may be a fighter pilot that ejected in some ancient battle only to be forgotten and left behind. Our study of the corpse has provided some interesting data."
 anomaly.625.a:0 "A tragic fate."
 anomaly.630.name:0 "Ancient Life Pod"
 anomaly.630.desc:0 "An abandoned life pod was detected in close orbit of §Y[From.GetName]§!. It is covered in scorch marks, presumably from when the pod's mothership exploded, and preliminary scans suggest it was built more than 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe crew of the [Root.GetName] managed to open the pod, revealing the withered remains of a reptilian alien clad in a resplendent uniform. Clutched in one of its claws was a small picture of another individual from the same race - possibly a mate or revered leader."
 anomaly.635.name:0 "Alien Writing"
 anomaly.635.desc:0 "Someone used a mining laser from orbit approximately five thousand years ago to carve a large body of writing into the surface of [From.GetName]. The massive script covers a large portion of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s upper hemisphere, and appears to be a short story chronicling the difficult life of an alien mercenary."
 anomaly.650.name:0 "Solar Sailer"
 anomaly.650.desc:0 "We have discovered an abandoned solar sail ship in orbit around §Y[From.GetName]§!. The sublight vessel was built by an unknown culture, and appears to be several thousand years old. One of the massive sails has a large tear where some kind of object passed through - most likely a meteoroid - which appears to have disabled the vessel. Although the technology of the ship is severely outdated, it does possess some interesting engineering design choices."
 anomaly.650.a:0 "An interesting albeit primitive design."
 anomaly.655.name:0 "Glancing Hit"
 anomaly.655.desc:0 "While approaching §Y[From.GetName]§!, the §Y[Root.GetName]§! suddenly received a glancing hit by several passing mass driver rounds. The projectiles were billions of years old, and based on their trajectory they appear to be stray rounds fired from a neighboring galaxy. After missing their intended target, they continued on their journey for untold millennia - until today. The rounds we have recovered are of an advanced design despite their incredible age."
 anomaly.660.name:0 "Towed Asteroid"
 anomaly.660.desc:1 "For some reason, someone has towed an asteroid into a stable orbit around §Y[From.GetName]§!. The massive engine sections and braking thrusters can still be found on the surface, although they have long since been rendered inoperable. Whoever did this also mined the asteroid for minerals, but these operations were seemingly abandoned shortly after they begun."
 anomaly.670.name:0 "Nuclear Devastation"
 anomaly.670.desc:0 "Our survey of §Y[From.GetName]§! has revealed that it used to be a pristine continental [From.GetPlanetMoon] with a mild climate as little as a thousand years ago. In stark contrast, the atmosphere today is extremely toxic, the surface highly irradiated and the world has long since lost the ability to support life.\n\nWe have detected signs that the [From.GetPlanetMoon] was the scene of an incredibly destructive thermonuclear war waged between factions of a relatively advanced indigenous pre-space civilization."
 anomaly.670.a:0 "What a waste."
 anomaly.675.name:0 "Nuclear Wasteland"
 anomaly.675.desc_01:0 "The survey of §Y[From.GetName]§! has revealed that the [From.GetPlanetMoon] is currently experiencing an ice age that seems to have been triggered by a global thermonuclear war many centuries ago. Most higher life forms have been killed off by the subsequent nuclear winter, including the post-atomic civilization that initiated the apocalyptic exchange."
 anomaly.675.desc_02:0 "The survey of §Y[From.GetName]§! has confirmed that this [From.GetPlanetMoon] was once a thriving tropical paradise before it was laid waste by a global thermonuclear war many centuries ago. Most higher life forms, including the post-atomic civilization that initiated the apocalyptic exchange, were killed off in the irradiated wasteland that remained after the dust settled."
 anomaly.680.name:0 "Gamma-Ray Burst"
 anomaly.680.desc:0 "24,000 years ago §Y[From.GetName]§! had the misfortune of being directly in the path of a long gamma-ray burst from a collapsing star within our galaxy. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] was washed with lethal radiation, which not only produced acute radiation poisoning in most life forms on the side of [From.GetName] that happened to be facing the burst, but also depleted much of the ozone layer.\n\nThis extinction event killed off an estimated 86% of all biota, including an early Bronze Age civilization whose ruins can still be found in some parts of the northern hemisphere.

Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has suggested that we spend additional resources on a more thorough analysis."
 anomaly.2501.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has deduced that [From.From.GetName] served as an orbital graveyard, where members of the dead alien species we found came to die. Gravity took care of the rest, slowly pulling the remains into the gas giant over a period of millions of years.\n\nThis ancient cycle seems to have stopped abruptly 15 million years ago when the last creature arrived.

 anomaly.2521.desc:1 "After continued studies of the massive skeletal remains found on [From.From.GetName], Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has concluded that the creature served as some kind of organic starship. Much smaller bones from at least three separate species were found within the larger skeleton, and we assume these came from members of the crew.\n\nFor unknown reasons, this organic starship suffered catastrophic damage and crash-landed on [From.From.GetName]. While we cannot begin to understand the biological engineering necessary to "grow" a starship like this, the study of these bones alone have substantially advanced our knowledge."
 anomaly.2522.desc:1 "Our continued studies of the massive skeletal remains on [From.From.GetName] have managed to shed some light on how the creature ended up on the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]. There are very faint residual energy readings that indicate some kind of dimensional portal existed briefly towards the rear of the skeleton.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] theorizes that the creature passed through this gateway from another dimension only to quickly perish in the hostile environment of [From.From.GetName]. Why it did this and where it came from are questions that may never be answered."

The surface on one side of the [From.GetPlanetMoon] is pockmarked with craters from stray weapons blasts, and scans from the [Root.GetName] have picked up several hulks on the ground.\n\nThough these wrecked ships are all in very poor condition, the fact that anything remains at all after the damage they must have sustained is a testament to their advanced design. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is preparing an expedition to sift through these derelict hulls for any valuable technologies."
 anomaly.2531.desc:1 "The team under Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has finished their expedition on [From.From.GetName] and returned to the [Root.GetName]. Thankfully, the starship graveyard on the surface proved to be a technological treasure trove.\n\nStudying the remains of these vessels has advanced our research in certain fields by several years, and there are yet things to discover. A permanent science outpost in orbit would be a great boon to our starship engineering efforts."
 anomaly.2532.desc:1 "The team under Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has finished their expedition on [From.From.GetName] and returned to the [Root.GetName]. Sadly, the wrecked starships on the surface were too badly damaged to recover any useful technologies.\n\nThese vessels were clearly very advanced, however, and we could gain valuable engineering insights if we analyze the way they were designed. We should consider the construction of a permanent science outpost in orbit."

We have prepared a special project to translate the text."
 anomaly.2541.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has managed to partially translate the alien mural discovered on [From.From.GetName]. It is a memorial for an extinct alien race that once maintained a small interstellar empire in this region of the galaxy. They were apparently exterminated by the creators of the mural, a fact that they seem to regret.\n\nGiven that the mural has been dated to be in excess of 300 million years old, it is likely that its creators are also extinct by now. Perhaps most interesting of all is the material that the mural was made of - despite its age, it is in remarkably good condition."
 anomaly.2542.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has managed to partially translate the alien mural discovered on [From.From.GetName]. The text contains a staggering amount of data, and the mural evidently serves as some sort of low-tech library. It describes, in broad terms, the collected technological knowledge of an alien civilization that dominated this region of the galaxy some 80 million years ago.\n\nA lot of it is already known to us, but the data does contain several promising leads for technologies we had yet to consider. There is enough data here to keep our scientists busy for decades, but we will need an orbital research facility to continue the translation efforts."

 anomaly.2561.desc:0 "In a masterful display of engineering, the team under Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has managed to gently raise the derelict ship on [From.From.GetName] to the gas giant's upper atmosphere. Despite its age, the ancient cruiser is in remarkably good condition and we have restored power to its systems. No trace of the original crew remains, but we have brought over our own and commissioned the ship into the fleet."
 anomaly.2562.desc:0 "The attempt by Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] to salvage the derelict ship from the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName] was a failure. The gas giant's heavy gravity disabled the engines of one of our engineering tugs, which then collided with the derelict. Several lives were lost, and the ancient vessel was pushed even deeper into the atmosphere - beyond our reach."
 anomaly.2570.name:0 "Terminal Orbit"
 anomaly.2570.desc:0 "One of the many moons circling [From.GetName] has a terminal orbit. It will soon collide with the gas giant in what is sure to become a massive impact event. This event has been millions of years in the making, and it is a startling coincidence that the impact has been fated to occur just after a visit by one of our ships.\n\nMany of our scientists wish to observe and record the event, but we only have a narrow window before it is too late."
 anomaly.2571.desc:0 "We were successful in our attempt to record the collision between [CollisionLocation.GetName] and its moon! The event was captured from several different angles, and transmitted live throughout our space. Most importantly, our scientists under the leadership of [Root.GetLeaderName] were able to record a large amount of valuable physics data that will surely benefit our research."
 anomaly.2572.desc:0 "We missed the chance to properly record the impact of the moon colliding with [From.From.GetName].

There are significant pockets of radiation in the gas giant's atmosphere that appear to be the result of intense orbital bombardment. What someone could hope to gain by bombing a gas giant from orbit remains a mystery however.\n\nAs the [Root.GetName] was preparing to break orbit, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] discovered a weak signal coming from the planet's interior. It may be a transmission of some kind, but the gas giant's background radiation makes it difficult to isolate."

It is always riveting to meet a solid, even if our last encounter with your kind was somewhat... problematic.\n\nYou have no doubt detected the radiation surges coming from our atmosphere. Tollok Rong is dying, and our species will perish unless we find a new home. We have identified a planet that would suit our physiology, but we have no means to get there. Sadly, our non-corporeal nature means we don't have much in the way of industry or technology. Will you help us?"
 anomaly.5003.a:0 "If you have no technology, how are we speaking?"
 anomaly.5003.a.response:0 "Ah, but you are not the first solid to pay us a visit! Another spacefarer graciously donated a small subspace transmitter and a scanner array to us 2.9 million solar cycles ago.

 anomaly.5003.b:0 "What happened to your planet?"
 anomaly.5003.b.response:0 "Well, the last time solids visited us a few thousand cycles ago, things didn't go very well. They wanted us to embrace their religion, we refused and this triggered some kind of genocidal reaction.\n\nCompletely unwarranted!

 anomaly.5003.c:0 "You want us to transport your entire species to another planet?"
 anomaly.5003.c.response:0 "Yes! And hopefully soon! Don't worry, there aren't too many of us.

 anomaly.5003.e.response:0 "I knew it! I warned the others that solids are incapable of feeling compassion, but they insisted on making this humiliating plea.\n\nI know you for what you are - a plague on this galaxy! One day it will be inherited by beings such as us, and there shall be a reckoning. Mark my words. The age of solids will be over! The time of the gaseous life form shall come!"
 anomaly.5004.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has finished supervising the relocation of the Dathnak to their new home. A convoy of civilian freighters equipped with massive pressurized gas tanks ferried the gaseous beings across space and deposited them into the gas giant's atmosphere.

Baldarak's strong gravity well pulls all kinds of trash into our atmosphere, and at a recent council meeting we decided to step up our cleaning efforts. One of our reclamation units came across a discarded cargo pod, and we're wondering if you'd be willing to help us dispose of it. It seems to contain large quantities of various worthless metals."

 DISC_FAILURE:0 "Failure"
 DISC_CRITICAL_FAILURE:0 "Critical Failure"
 anomaly_failure.1.desc:1 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] ordered the [Root.GetName] to dispatch a probe to investigate the crater on [From.From.GetName]. Unfortunately, its braking thrusters failed and the probe proceeded to smash right into the wrecked ship at the center of the crater."
 anomaly_failure.2.desc:0 "Although asteroid [From.From.GetName] may be an extrasolar capture, it is completely unremarkable in every other sense. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the crew of the [Root.GetName] have asked for permission to continue their mission of exploration elsewhere."
 anomaly_failure.3.desc:0 "The entire crew of the [Root.GetName] spent days arduously sifting through the debris on the surface of [From.From.GetName] in rotating shifts. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that nothing of value was found."
 anomaly_failure.4.desc:0 "No source of the strange energy emissions coming from asteroid [From.From.GetName] was ever found. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the [Root.GetName] are awaiting new orders."
 anomaly_failure.5.desc:0 "While attempting to open the docking hatch we found on [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] accidentally caused a tremor inside the asteroid. Unfortunately, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has deduced that this likely led to the destruction of the asteroid's interior."
 anomaly_failure.6.desc:0 "The investigation of the massive surface crater on asteroid [From.From.GetName] has yielded nothing of interest. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has ordered the [Root.GetName] to discontinue the mission."
 anomaly_failure.7.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] made a failed attempt to dock with the space station orbiting [From.From.GetName]. Unfortunately, the fragile station disintegrated as a result. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] begs forgiveness."
 anomaly_failure.7.desc.mach:0 "The [Root.GetName] made a failed attempt to dock with the space station orbiting [From.From.GetName]. Unfortunately, the fragile station disintegrated as a result. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that an unfortunate software glitch concerning trajectory calculations was to blame."
 anomaly_failure.8.desc:0 "The source of the life signs that were reported on asteroid [From.From.GetName], if indeed there ever was one, has not been found despite repeated scans by the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has requested new orders."
 anomaly_failure.9.desc:0 "If there truly is an object somewhere beneath the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName], it lies far too deep to be detected by the sensors of the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has abandoned the search."
 anomaly_failure.10.desc:0 "After an extensive survey of the small moonlet circling [From.From.GetName], the crew of the [Root.GetName] found nothing of worth. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has terminated the mission."
 anomaly_failure.11.desc:0 "Acting on orders from Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], the [Root.GetName] sent a probe into the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName] to investigate the life signs that had been reported. The presence of a rich atmospheric ecosystem was discovered, but 3.4 seconds later the probe contaminated the atmosphere and triggered a chemical chain-reaction that spread rapidly across the entire gas giant. No signs of life can be detected now."
 anomaly_failure.12.desc:0 "Nothing particularly interesting has been discovered about the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName], despite an extensive analysis that included a brief trip into the gas giant's upper atmosphere by the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has recommended an end to the mission."
 anomaly_failure.13.desc:0 "As the [Root.GetName] approached the aerostat structures in the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName], the ship must have triggered some kind of proximity alarm. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the structures suddenly lost all buoyancy and plummeted into the gas giant's lower atmosphere."
 anomaly_failure.14.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] inadvertently bumped into the cargo pod orbiting [From.From.GetName] while trying to collect it. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the collision sent the pod deep into the gas giant's atmosphere, from where it can no longer be retrieved."
 anomaly_failure.15.desc:0 "The debris field that surrounds [From.From.GetName] has been thoroughly scanned by the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports no significant findings."
 anomaly_failure.16.desc:0 "Despite a thorough investigation, the [Root.GetName] has still not been able to deduce what caused the massive impact crater on [From.From.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] apologizes for this failure."
 anomaly_failure.16.desc.mach:0 "Despite a thorough investigation, the [Root.GetName] has still not been able to deduce what caused the massive impact crater on [From.From.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has logged the failure as due to insufficient residue remaining on the surface of the moon."
 anomaly_failure.17.desc:0 "If there were anomalous energy readings coming from [From.From.GetName], they appear to be gone now. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the [Root.GetName] has detected nothing of the sort."
 anomaly_failure.18.desc:0 "There WAS some sort of unidentified object in orbit around [From.From.GetName], but the [Root.GetName] accidentally collided with it when moving closer to investigate. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the object, regrettably, was destroyed in the collision."
 anomaly_failure.19.desc:0 "No distinguishing features were found on the small asteroid that had seemingly been towed into orbit around [From.From.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is requesting new orders for the [Root.GetName]."
 anomaly_failure.20.desc:0 "Sadly, the solar sailer found above [From.From.GetName] was destroyed in a clumsy attempt by Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] to bring it into the cargo bay of the [Root.GetName]."
 anomaly_failure.21.desc:0 "The initial survey report, which mentioned life signs originating from the surface of [From.From.GetName], must have been mistaken, as nothing of the sort has been found by the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] now appears to be completely devoid of life."
 anomaly_failure.22.desc:0 "What was thought to have been a hidden orbital station above [From.From.GetName] has been identified as garbage ejected by the very Science Ship that conducted the initial survey of the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the crew of the [Root.GetName] suggest that we forget about this embarrassing episode and move on."
 anomaly_failure.23.desc:0 "After careful analysis, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has determined that the ship debris found above [From.From.GetName] originated from a single garbage scow. [Root.GetName] collected some of the debris, but it appears to be completely worthless."
 anomaly_failure.24.desc:0 "Deep scans from the [Root.GetName] seem to have triggered some kind of cascading power failure in the ancient shipyard orbiting [From.From.GetName]. It blew up in a spectacular explosion, according to Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName]."
 anomaly_failure.25.desc:0 "The "city ruins" that were reported on the surface of [From.From.GetName] turned out to be nothing but unusually shaped rock formations. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] apologizes for this waste of resources, and has requested a new mission for the [Root.GetName]."
 anomaly_failure.26.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has reported that the origin of the scarring that was observed on the surface of [From.From.GetName] turned out to be natural after all. The [Root.GetName] needs a new assignment."
 anomaly_failure.27.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] lost the weak signal that was coming from [From.From.GetName], and despite the best efforts of Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], all attempts to track it down again have met with failure."
 anomaly_failure.28.desc:0 "The "unnatural" mountain formation that was found on [From.From.GetName] turned out to be quite natural after all. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] feels that it would be an unfortunate waste of resources for the [Root.GetName] to remain here even a second longer."
 anomaly_failure.29.desc:0 "Despite repeated attempts, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the rest of the crew of the [Root.GetName] were unable to locate the reflecting object that was reported in the initial survey of [From.From.GetName]. Perhaps it was just a sensor glitch."
 anomaly_failure.30.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] was unable to locate the source of the faint transmission we detected coming from the interior of [From.From.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the transmission has since ceased completely."
 anomaly_failure.31.desc:0 "Despite repeated scans by the [Root.GetName], no hint of the vessel that was supposedly hidden within the atmosphere of [From.From.GetName] has been found. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has expressed doubt that it ever existed."
 anomaly_failure.32.desc:0 "After recalculating the orbit of the moon that was supposedly on a collision course with [From.From.GetName], Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has arrived at the conclusion that it will simply be a near miss. The [Root.GetName] should be redeployed to deal with more pressing matters."
 anomaly_failure.33.desc:0 "The signs of Vultaum activity in the vicinity of [From.From.GetName] turned out to be false leads. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has asked to continue the search with the [Root.GetName] elsewhere."
 anomaly_failure.34.desc:0 "The signs of Yuht activity in the vicinity of [From.From.GetName] turned out to be false leads. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has asked to continue the search with the [Root.GetName] elsewhere."

 anomaly_failure.400.desc:1 "For unclear reasons, the resident Science Officer decided to take out a shuttle from the [Root.GetName] to personally investigate asteroid [From.From.GetName]. An explosion was detected shortly afterwards when the shuttle accidentally impacted the asteroid's surface.\n\nA Board of Inquiry later determined that the late scientist had not been trained to operate a class-D shuttlecraft."
 anomaly_failure.401.desc:0 "While maneuvering to investigate [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] accidentally collided with another asteroid. The ship careened out of control until it impacted on the surface of [From.From.GetName], plowing deep into the asteroid's crust.\n\nThe Science Officer on board was reported lost along with the rest of the crew."
 anomaly_failure.402.desc:0 "While maneuvering to investigate [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] accidentally collided with another asteroid. The ship careened out of control until it impacted on the surface of [From.From.GetName], plowing deep into the asteroid's crust.\n\nA small group of survivors, including the ship's Science Officer, managed to escape the doomed vessel in an escape pod."
 anomaly_failure.403.desc:0 "This asteroid serves as a nesting ground for some kind of large vacuum-based life form! Several of them sally forth from their tunnel network to aggressively defend their territory from the [Root.GetName]."
 creature_nest:0 "Hostile creatures closing fast!"
 anomaly_failure.404.desc:0 "Several dormant military-grade drones designed by some long lost civilization sit clustered together in a small crater on the far side of [From.From.GetName]. As the [Root.GetName] comes within range of their passive sensors, the drones power up in an effort to fulfill their ancient programming directive - defend the system from intruders at all costs."
 dormant_drones:0 "Attack drones approaching!"
 anomaly_failure.405.desc:0 "Active scans from the [Root.GetName] briefly picked up several structures on the surface of [From.From.GetName], only to have the signal drowned out by jamming interference seconds later. Several pirate ships have darted out of a hidden hangar on the asteroid and are now approaching in attack formation!"
 pirate_outpost:0 "Those pirates mean business!"
 anomaly_failure.900.desc:0 "Tragic news from [From.From.GetName]. The Science Officer in charge was killed by an electrical discharge while traveling inside the gas giant's upper atmosphere in a small shuttlecraft. The crew of the [Root.GetName] have aborted their mission."
 anomaly_failure.901.desc:0 "We are still trying to piece together the details, but for some reason it looks like the Science Officer ordered the [Root.GetName] into the upper atmosphere of [From.From.GetName] to investigate a sensor anomaly. Once there the stress to the vessel's hull eventually became too great, and it was lost with all hands."
 anomaly_failure.902.desc:0 "While conducting deep scans of [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] suffered a reactor failure and became trapped inside the gas giant's gravity well. The vessel's Science Officer successfully oversaw the evacuation of the entire crew, but the ship itself was pulled into the planet's dense atmosphere never to be seen again."
 anomaly_failure.903.desc:0 "While approaching [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] stumbled upon two unknown vessels hiding in the gas giant's sensor shadow. They appear to be smugglers partaking in some kind of clandestine meeting. As soon as they spotted your ship, the smuggler ships disconnected from each other and powered up their weapons. They seem intent on not leaving any witnesses!"
 smuggler_rendezvous:0 "The smugglers charge forward!"
 anomaly_failure.1400.desc:0 "During operations above [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] suffered a containment breach in its reactor core. The safety of the entire ship was put into jeopardy, but thanks to a valiant act of sacrifice by the vessel's Science Officer the engine room was successfully purged of radiation. Unfortunately, the scientist received a lethal dose of radiation poisoning and could not be saved."
 anomaly_failure.1400.desc.mach:0 "During operations above [From.From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] suffered a containment breach in its reactor core. As the safety of the entire ship was put into jeopardy, the vessel's Science Officer made the logical conclusion to sacrifice itself in order to purge the engine room of radiation, based on pre-programmed casualty weighting. In the process, [Root.GetLeaderName] received a dose of radiation large enough to result in semiconductor ionization and silicon lattice displacement damage, rendering them permanently inoperable. The ship and remaining crew, however, were saved."
 anomaly_failure.1401.desc:0 "While rerouting power to its main sensor array, the [Root.GetName] experienced a critical reactor failure above [From.From.GetName]. The vessel's Science Officer perished in the resulting explosion, along with the rest of the crew."
 anomaly_failure.1402.desc:0 "We are uncertain exactly how it happened, but somehow the ship's Science Officer inadvertently triggered the self-destruct sequence on the [Root.GetName] while running a simulation related to [From.From.GetName] on the ship's onboard computer. All attempts to abort the sequence met with failure, and the entire crew was forced to evacuate before the ship was destroyed."
 anomaly_failure.1403.desc:0 "Several pirate ships suddenly launch from where they had been hidden on the surface of [From.From.GetName]. It appears that the [Root.GetName] has stumbled upon a pirate anchorage, and the cutthroats are none too pleased at this intrusion!"
 pirate_anchorage:0 "Incoming vessels with hostile intent!"
 anomaly_failure.1404.desc:0 "The orbital space over [From.From.GetName] is apparently used as some sort of mating ground by a large and aggressive species of spacefaring creatures. Angry at being disturbed by the [Root.GetName] in the middle of their coupling, two of the creatures set off to deal with the unwelcome intruder."
 mating_ground:0 "Those creatures are looking very agitated."
 anomaly_failure.1405.desc:0 "A small squadron of ancient combat drones appears to have been abandoned in orbit of [From.From.GetName] after some long forgotten battle. As the active sensors of the [Root.GetName] sweep over them, the drones power up and enter attack mode!"
 combat_drones:0 "They are coming in weapons hot!"

 colony.1.name:0 "Migrating Forests"
 colony.1.desc:0 "The surface of [Root.GetName] is covered in lush forests, with massive tree analogues rising hundreds of meters into the air. Interestingly, our colonists have found that nearly all of the flora is mobile to various degrees. Forests stretching for miles will slowly migrate to new areas richer in nutrients in a cycle that seems tied to the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s orbit.\n\nUnfortunately, this has seriously hampered our efforts to develop the colony's infrastructure. The migrating trees frequently cut power lines while smashing our buildings and roads into rubble."
 colony.1.a:0 "We need to find a solution."
 colony.2.desc:0 "We have learned that the roaming forests on [From.From.GetName] avoid certain regions that are home to colonies of a native pseudo-insect. These insects secrete a pheromone that can be used to steer the wandering trees away from population centers.\n\nFurthermore, the areas where the forests most frequently range have been closed off as nature reserves. Our biologists can learn much by studying this reserve from the neighboring regions."
 colony.2.a.tooltip:0 "§YDocile Migrating Forests§! modifier added, giving the following effects:\n£blocker  §YWandering Forest Reserve§! added, improving £society  §YResearch§! on neighboring tiles"
 colony.3.desc:0 "A napalm bombing campaign has been effective in decimating the migrating forests on [From.From.GetName]. The massive firestorms have left a smoldering landscape in their wake, in which our ecologists have planted more traditional and significantly less mobile off-world trees. Losses to the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s wildlife have been substantial, but within acceptable limits."
 colony.4.name:0 "Rise of the Trees"
 colony.4.desc:0 "The migrating forests on [Root.GetName] have resurfaced! We knew isolated pockets of their kind had survived in several remote areas, but they appeared dormant. It seems they used this reprieve to replenish their numbers, and they have begun to systematically attack our settlements.\n\nContrary to what we believed, they clearly possess some form of rudimentary intelligence, and they're out for revenge!"
 colony.4.a:0 "They must be stopped!"
 tree_armies:0 "Hordes of trees are attacking our colonists on [Root.GetName]!"
 colony.5.name:0 "Fall of the Trees"
 colony.5.desc:0 "Many settlements and lives were lost to the rampaging trees on [From.From.GetName], but we managed to push them back and exterminate the last of their kind. Squads equipped with flamethrowers are making absolutely certain that no trees are overlooked this time."
 colony.5.a:0 "That should teach them."
 colony.6.name:0 "Mineral Deposits"
 colony.6.desc:0 "We have discovered several significant mineral deposits that had previously been obscured by the roving forests on [Root.GetName]. Now that the trees have been reduced to ashes, the deposits are easy to access."
 colony.7.name:0 "Precious Metal Deposit"
 colony.7.desc:0 "We have discovered a significant deposit of precious metals that had previously been obscured by the roving forests on [Root.GetName]. Now that the trees have been reduced to ashes, the deposit is easy to access."
 colony.8.name:0 "Ecological Damage"
 colony.8.desc:0 "It would appear the migrating forests we exterminated on [Root.GetName] played a more vital role in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s ecology than previously thought. The wildfires we started and the absence of the forests have led to the extinction of several local species, resulting in a domino effect that has claimed several species of predators as well.\n\nEfforts are ongoing to at least partly restore the fragile ecological balance by introducing new flora and fauna from other worlds, but it is a difficult process that will take time."
 colony.9.name:0 "Forest Adaptation"
 colony.9.desc:0 "Continued interaction between our colonists and the wandering forests on [Root.GetName] has revealed that the trees are in possession of some form of rudimentary communal intelligence. They seem to have adapted to our presence, and now go out of their way to avoid damaging the property of our colonists even without the use of the insect pheromone. Spirits among the colonists have risen."
 colony.10.name:0 "Forest Research"
 colony.10.desc:0 "We have learned a great deal by living in proximity of the wandering forests on [Root.GetName]. Some enterprising colonists have even built homes in the treetops of some of the larger specimens, following the forests around as they migrate across the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. Some of the foremost biologists in the [Root.Owner.GetName] have spent time studying these unique trees."
 colony.11.name:0 "Forest Fire"
 colony.11.desc:0 "A forest fire caused by lightning on [Root.GetName] created something akin to a stampede among the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s wandering forests. Their wild panic brought them into areas they had previously avoided, resulting in widespread damage to the colony's terrain."
 colony.12.name:0 "Wandering Forests Migrate"
 colony.12.desc:0 "The colonial authorities on [Root.GetName] have reported that one of the local wandering forests has migrated to another region on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]! Hundreds of thousands of trees have uprooted and marched in unison to this new area, trampling everything in their path."
 colony.50.name:0 "Seismic Disturbances"
 colony.50.desc:0 "There have been many reports of unexplainable seismic disturbances on [Root.GetName]. Tremors can be felt across the [Root.GetPlanetMoon], and many of our settlements have suffered damage. While investigating the earthquakes, our scientists discovered a vast network of subterranean caverns.\n\nThe deepest of these caverns are home to some kind of indigenous civilization, and they appear to be tunneling towards the surface! Ground vibrations from our settlements may have triggered this behavior, but we cannot be certain. There is no telling how these aliens will react when they spill out of their tunnels and encounter our colonists!"
 colony.50.a:0 "We have to deal with this situation."
 colony.51.desc:0 "One of our probes burrowed through the ground and intercepted the tunneling aliens on [From.From.GetName]. After the startled alien workers calmed down, the probe was successful in establishing communications with their leaders."
 colony.51.a:0 "Open a channel."
 colony.52.desc:0 "Our efforts to destroy the subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] have met with success! We managed to collapse several of their tunnels on top of their workers, and the caverns that housed their cities have been flooded with nerve gas.\n\nCasualty projections are close to 100%, and our security forces are confident they will be able to deal with any surviving stragglers."

 colony.53.desc:0 "Is this thing on? Can you see us, surfacers? We understand you hail from the Great Nothing that lies upwards, beyond the stone. It was assumed nothing living could exist there, but evidently this is not so. What are your intentions?"
 colony.53.a:0 "Tell us about yourselves."
 colony.53.a.response:0 "Our empire stretches across every pocket of the known world. Only the Great Nothing lies beyond our reach. We have many fine cities, supported by lichen farms and the fish we catch in the large rivers flowing through our tunnels.\n\nThis has been our way for thousands of years. Our diggers heard the faint echoes of your cities through the stone, and we decided to investigate."
 colony.53.b:0 "We would like to coexist in peace."
 colony.53.b.response:0 "Then so we shall, surfacer! Let us share this world together in the spirit of peace. We would be most interested in trading with your people. I believe we have much to offer one another. We shall return to our cities and make the arrangements."
 colony.53.c:0 "Submit or be destroyed."
 colony.53.c.response:0 "Ha! It is you who will submit to us! We could have lived side by side in peace, but now our armies will claim the Great Nothing and annex it to our empire. It has always been our destiny to rule all of creation."

 subterranean_invasion:0 "Hostile armies are attacking our colony on [Root.GetName]!"
 colony.55.desc:0 "The earthquakes that were plaguing [From.From.GetName] were caused by the tunneling efforts of a previously unknown subterranean civilization native to the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]! They have breached the surface, and large armies equipped with primitive yet lethal projectile weapons are spilling from the tunnels. Their vanguard has already begun an assault on our settlements.

 colony.56.desc:0 "Our forces have managed to drive the subterranean aliens on [From.From.GetName] back into their underground lairs, and they are contained for the moment. This is a temporary solution, however, and it is only a matter of time before they break out onto the surface again.\n\nWe need to strike at them below ground, and our strategists have devised a new attack plan. It has been added to the Situation Log."

 colony.61.name:0 "Collapse"
 colony.61.desc:0 "Grave news from [Root.GetName]! The subterranean aliens we have been fighting there somehow managed to collapse the ground under an entire army that was stationed near one of their tunnel entrances.\n\nThe few soldiers that survived the fall were quickly butchered by the aliens before they could be reached by the rest of our forces."
 colony.61.a:0 "They will pay for this!"
 colony.62.name:0 "Raiding Parties"
 colony.62.desc:0 "The aliens living below our colony on [Root.GetName] have been sending out small raiding parties from their tunnels at night. Their attacks have destroyed one of the colony's major installations, and before our forces could respond the raiders had vanished underground."
 colony.62.a:0 "These raids must stop!"
 colony.63.name:0 "Surface Attack"
 colony.63.desc:0 "There has been another attack on [Root.GetName]! The subterranean aliens emerged from new tunnels in the middle of one of our major settlements. They overwhelmed the local defenses and butchered our colonists. A few screaming survivors were dragged underground by the aliens when they retreated back into their tunnels."
 colony.63.a:0 "These murders will not go unanswered."
 colony.64.name:0 "Survivor Pocket"
 colony.64.desc:0 "Our forces on [Root.GetName] are still mapping the tunnel network below our colony. They have come upon a large city belonging to the subterranean aliens that managed to isolate itself from the rest of their underground empire before we flooded it with nerve gas. There are millions of frightened aliens in the city. Should our engineers collapse the cavern to finish the job?"

 colony.66.name:0 "Gold!"
 colony.66.desc:0 "Prospectors have ventured into some of the deeper tunnels that once belonged to the now dead subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName]. They have finally discovered the long-rumored gold mines where it was believed the underground alien empire acquired its large reserve of precious metals!"
 colony.67.name:0 "Treasury"
 colony.67.desc:0 "Scout units exploring the tunnel network on [Root.GetName] have entered the royal palace in what was once the capital city of the underground alien empire. The corpse of what passed for their emperor is still perched on a massive throne in the main chamber.\n\nAfter using explosive charges to breach the palace treasury, our scouts found it filled with gold and strange alien art. The art will be shipped back to museums on [From.Owner.Capital.GetName], and the sale of the gold should provide a nice boost to our state budget."
 colony.68.name:0 "Earthquakes on [Root.GetName]"

 colony.71.name:0 "Subterranean Refugees"
 colony.71.desc:0 "A large group of refugees from the underground alien empire on [Root.GetName] recently streamed out of their tunnels onto the surface, chased by a small army. They are apparently part of some sort of religious minority, and claim to be fleeing persecution.\n\nIf we let them join our colonists on the surface, it will no doubt anger the rulers of the empire they fled from. However, if we let the pursuing army take them back underground, they will likely face mass execution."

They have learned much about their ancient ways and customs, which will no doubt benefit our society research."
 colony.73.desc:0 "There has been a wave of earthquakes on [Root.GetName] recently, and buildings in several of our settlements have collapsed with many fatalities as a result.

 colony.100.desc:0 "Since our initial settlement of [Root.GetName], several anomalies in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s biosphere have been discovered. The ecosystem is unstable and has not developed according to projected models for a world of this type. Our scientists suspect outside tampering, and these suspicions have now been confirmed!\n\nA few of our colonists have stumbled upon a large underground terraforming complex that was built thousands of years ago. The equipment was apparently deactivated in the middle of the terraforming process, leaving the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s biosphere in its current unfinished state. If we supply enough power, we should be able to reactivate the machinery. There is no telling what the end result will be like, however..."

 colony.102.name:0 "Unstable Weather"
 colony.102.desc:0 "In large part due to the interrupted terraforming process on [Root.GetName], the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] has a somewhat unstable climate.

They have spawned millions of horribly deformed creatures. Most of them died within moments when their twisted bodies collapsed, but the survivors have massed together in a throbbing, shrieking horde. To make matters worse, they appear to be flocking towards our main settlements!"

 colony.107.desc:0 "The aborted terraforming process on [Root.GetName] has been completed with horrific results!

 colony.109.name:0 "Marauding Creature"
 colony.109.desc:0 "Our colonists on [Root.GetName] are still encountering scattered survivors from the mutated creatures that spawned after we finished the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s aborted terraforming process. Most are relatively harmless and can be put out of their misery by local militia forces, but one creature in particular has been spreading terror in our outlying settlements. There are reports of it stalking our citizens, and there have been dozens of unexplained disappearances.\n\nThe mutilated remains of the security team that was sent to investigate the matter were recently discovered, prompting the colony's leaders to request off-world military support."
 colony.109.a:0 "This creature needs to be chased down and killed!"
 colony.110.desc:0 "After an extensive search, our forces on [From.From.GetName] managed to corner the mutated beast that had been killing our colonists. A special forces team ventured into the creature's lair and managed to kill it after a vicious battle. The grisly remains of hundreds of butchered colonists were found in the nest, as well as half a dozen traumatized survivors that appears to have been kept alive for later consumption.\n\nThe beast's colossal head has been parted from its body, and now serves as the regimental symbol of the forces that were directly involved in its demise."
 colony.111.name:0 "Creature Sightings Cease"
 colony.111.desc:0 "Sightings of the mutated creature that was hunting colonists on [Root.GetName] have ceased, and there have been no more disappearances. It seems likely that the creature has perished of its own accord - either through old age, or perhaps because if choked to death while eating another of our colonists.\n\nWhile the population of [Root.GetName] are relieved that the nightmare has finally ended, they are none too pleased at our failure to protect them."

 colony.112.name:0 "Creature Sightings Increase"
 colony.112.desc:0 "Sightings of the creature that has been killing our colonists on [Root.GetName] have risen dramatically in recent times, and so has the amount of disappearances among the population. The fact that several creatures have been sighted together clearly indicates that the original beast has been breeding somehow.\n\nSwarms of these horrors now rampage in the open, indiscriminately butchering our colonists in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s rural regions.

 colony.150.name:0 "Underground Vault"
 colony.150.desc:0 "Geological surveys conducted by our colonists on [Root.GetName] have revealed a massive vault buried deep inside a mountain range. All evidence points towards this being some kind of fallout shelter built by the same species that perished in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s ancient nuclear war.\n\nThe vault has been sealed for many centuries, but our instruments have detected a faint power signature emanating from within. Our scientists are eager to open the vault and discover what lies behind its reinforced doors."
 colony.150.a:0 "Let's crack this thing open!"
 colony.150.b:0 "Best to leave this thing be."
 colony.151.desc:0 "Our science expedition has finally managed to open the vault on [Root.GetName], but they found nothing but ancient skeletal remains inside. It would seem that the vault's original inhabitants ran out of food approximately 200 years ago, at which point they turned on each other in some sort of cannibalistic frenzy. The scattered bones, many of them covered in gnaw marks, paint a grisly picture of the final moments that were experienced by the last survivors of this once proud civilization.\n\nOn the bright side, the logs and data libraries inside the vault should be enough to keep our behavioral scientists and xeno psychologists busy for many years to come."
 colony.152.desc:0 "The great vault on [Root.GetName] has been unsealed. To the surprise of our scientists, the vast complex behind the massive vault doors housed millions of survivors from the ancient nuclear war that once ravaged this world. Despite their limited resources, they have managed to maintain a self-sufficient society for centuries. They were wary of our scientists at first, having never encountered aliens before, but also deeply grateful for our help in opening the vault.\n\nThe vault contains large stores of equipment and machinery that was specifically designed for rebuilding civilization after a nuclear holocaust. It can only be operated by these aliens, but they seem more than willing to join your colonists on the surface once they have adapted to natural sunlight again."

Thousands of colonists have been butchered, with entire settlements falling to the ravenous horde. We have fortified our remaining cities and established defensive perimeters, but this may not be enough!"

 colony.155.name:0 "Nuclear Bomb"
 colony.155.desc:0 "While exploring some ruins near one of our major settlements on [Root.GetName], a few colonists inadvertently activated the timer on an undetonated hydrogen bomb left over from the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s previous nuclear war.\n\nWith an estimated yield of 35 megatons, the bomb will wipe out several population centers if it detonates. It isn't stable enough to be moved and there is no time to evacuate the entire region."
 colony.155.a:0 "We must disarm it!"
 colony.156.desc:0 "We have successfully disarmed the hydrogen bomb on [From.From.GetName]! It has been safely disposed of and specialist teams are now scouring the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface of any other undetonated munitions. This will hopefully reduce the chances of another incident like this occurring."
 colony.156.a:0 "We dodged a bullet."
 colony.157.desc:0 "Our bomb disposal team failed to defuse the hydrogen bomb on [From.From.GetName] in time. They, along with every other living thing within a 100 kilometer radius, were eradicated when the bomb detonated. Untold lives have been lost, the last victims of a tragic and pointless war that began millennia ago."
 colony.157.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 colony.160.name:0 "Ruined Particle Accelerator"
 colony.160.desc:0 "We have discovered what appears to be the remains of a massive particle accelerator on [Root.GetName]. It was found in a still-radioactive region covered in massive bomb craters, suggesting the accelerator was considered a strategic target of great importance during the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s nuclear war.\n\nWe have recovered several research logs written by the scientist in charge of the accelerator. Although the technology of her civilization was fairly primitive, some of the theoretical research and formulas described in the logs are advanced even by our standards. Our physicists are poring over the data now."
 colony.161.name:0 "Surviving Infrastructure"
 colony.161.desc:0 "Infrastructure that survived the great nuclear war which ruined [Root.GetName] have proved a great boon to our colonists. The alien civilization that once lived here built highways connecting their major population centers, and some of them are still in good enough condition to be used today.\n\nWe have also been able to recycle a large amount of building material from the many ruins that dot the landscape, further improving our colony's infrastructure."
 colony.162.name:0 "Derelict Space Station"
 colony.162.desc:0 "A small team from our colony on [Root.GetName] recently boarded a primitive space station that had been left in orbit by the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s original inhabitants. The mummified remains of the station's crew could still be found clustered around viewports facing the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. They must have realized they were doomed after seeing the billowing mushroom clouds below, and communication logs shows that the astronauts made several futile and increasingly frantic attempts to contact the surface before they eventually ran out of supplies.\n\nThe station is in good condition, and it has afforded our engineers a rare glimpse of the early stages of a planetary space program. They have gained several ideas from the primitive yet ingenious solutions used in the station's design."
 colony.163.name:0 "Wasteland Radiation"
 colony.163.desc:0 "The radiation levels in some wasteland regions of [Root.GetName] appear to be greater than our previous scans had indicated. Colonists in several local settlements have complained of poor health, and birth rates are down. We are taking steps to evacuate the affected regions, but these measures will take time."
 colony.164.name:0 "Pacifist Movement"
 colony.164.desc:0 "The decrepit ruins and desolate wastelands found on [Root.GetName] seem to have prompted many of the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s colonists to adopt some kind of pacifistic philosophy.\n\nMembers of this new movement claim that the environment they live in serve as a daily reminder of the senseless horrors of war. They see it as their civic duty to prevent the terrible destruction visited upon [Root.GetName] from occurring on other worlds."
 colony.164.a:0 "Do they, now?"
 colony.164.b:0 "These wretched cowards shame our nation!"
 colony.164.c:0 "Excellent. Everyone should give peace a chance."
 colony.164.a.tooltip:0 "Up to §Y4 Pops§! on §H[Root.GetName]§! lose any §YMilitaristic ethics§! and gain the §YFanatic Pacifist§! ethic"
 colony.170.name:0 "Orbital Debris"
 colony.170.desc:0 "The orbital space around [Root.GetName] is cluttered with debris left behind by the alien civilization that once inhabited the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. Before they wiped themselves out, their early space programs saw the launch of thousands of primitive satellites and missile launch platforms. Many of these were destroyed by anti-satellite weapons during the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s destructive nuclear war, adding even more space junk to the mix.\n\nOur colony on the surface has developed to a point where this dense field of debris is interfering with its infrastructure. We cannot use satellites and civilian orbital flights are limited to narrow launch windows."
 colony.170.a:0 "Perhaps something should be done."
 colony.171.name:0 "Freighter Crash"
 colony.171.desc:0 "A civilian freighter coming in to land on [Root.GetName] was perforated by a dense cloud of fast-moving orbital debris! The flight crew was killed immediately, and the stricken craft tumbled through the atmosphere only to crash-land near one of the colony's main power relays. The resulting explosion resulted in several deaths on the ground, and local infrastructure suffered considerable damage."
 colony.171.desc.mach:0 "A worker unit freighter coming in to land on [Root.GetName] was perforated by a dense cloud of fast-moving orbital debris! The flight crew units were destroyed instantly, and the stricken craft tumbled through the atmosphere only to crash-land near one of the colony's main power relays. The resulting explosion resulted in several operation terminations on the ground, and local infrastructure suffered considerable damage."
 colony.171.a:0 "Of all the luck...!"
 colony.172.name:0 "Debris Impact"
 colony.172.desc:0 "A cascade of collisions in the dense layer of debris surrounding [Root.GetName] recently shifted the orbit of a large piece of space junk. The object - which we believe was one of the many orbital missile platforms used in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s nuclear war - was pulled into the atmosphere, and unfortunately proceeded to impact directly on top of a major settlement. Initial reports indicate heavy casualties."
 colony.172.a:0 "We really need to do something about that debris."
 colony.173.desc:0 "With the assistance of our Science Ship, colonial authorities on [Root.GetName] have finished cleaning up the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s orbital space. It has now been made safe for satellites and civilian travel."
 colony.174.desc:0 "With the assistance of our Science Ship, colonial authorities on [Root.GetName] have finished cleaning up the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s orbital space. It has now been made safe for satellites and civilian travel.\n\nAs it turns out, a lot of the debris consisted of valuable minerals from the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface that had been used in satellite construction. We were able to salvage a significant amount, netting a tidy profit in the process."
 colony.180.name:0 "Asteroid Sighted"
 colony.180.desc:0 "Our deep space tracking arrays on [Root.GetName] have made an alarming discovery - a large asteroid is heading towards the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] on a direct collision course! Should it impact the surface, the consequences would be disastrous.\n\nThe asteroid must be destroyed before it is too late!"

 colony.182.desc:0 "The asteroid that was approaching [Root.GetName] on a collision course has been destroyed! With their doom averted, our jubilant citizens on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] have taken to the streets in celebration.\n\nA scan of the remaining fragments has also revealed that the asteroid consisted largely of valuable minerals. We have collected what we could."
 colony.182.desc.mach:0 "The asteroid that was approaching [Root.GetName] on a collision course has been destroyed! No planetside units or structures have been affected by the event, as any inbound debris was small enough to disintigrate on atmospheric entry.\n\nA scan of the remaining fragments has also revealed that the asteroid consisted largely of valuable minerals. We have collected what we could."

 precursor.completed.a:0 "An interesting find."
 precursor.1.name:0 "The Vultaum Star Assembly"
 precursor.1.desc:1 "We have recovered artifacts from an ancient alien civilization on §Y[From.GetName]§!! They must have been active in this region of space approximately 12 million years ago, judging by the age of the artifacts.\n\nFrom what they have been able to piece together, our scientists theorize that these aliens, who called themselves the "Vultaum Star Assembly," were worm-like annelids, roughly 3 to 4 meters in length, that communicated with each other primarily through vibrations carried along their segmented bodies."
 precursor.5.name:0 "Vultaum Mining Base"
 precursor.5.desc:0 "Remnants of a small Vultaum helium-3 mining base have been found at the bottom of a large crater on [From.GetName]. The blast that created the crater seems to have originated from inside the facility itself. Unless Vultaum mining techniques were radically different from our own, an equipment failure or accident cannot account for such a massive explosion."
 precursor.6.desc:1 "Miraculously, we managed to salvage parts of a Vultaum data core that had been blown clear of the crater on [From.From.GetName]. Most of the data was corrupt, but our scientists did manage to properly translate the "korga" - the basic Vultaum time unit."
 precursor.10.name:0 "Vultaum Observatory"
 precursor.10.desc:0 "An ancient Vultaum observatory has been found on the surface of §Y[From.GetName]§!. The [From.GetStarName] system is fairly distant from the region of space where the Vultaum originated, and this facility appears to have been primarily used for the observation of their own stars.\n\nWe have gone over the observatory's surviving data, but there are no clues as to exactly what the Vultaum were searching for in their observations."
 precursor.11.desc:1 "The archaeological dig on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has uncovered a small mural in one of the observatory's dust-covered smaller chambers. It seems to depict several different constellations, possibly as they would appear if viewed from the Vultaum homeworld. Our astronomers have not been able to identify the individual stars."
 precursor.15.name:0 "Vultaum Colony"
 precursor.15.desc:0 "The partial remains of a collapsed Vultaum space elevator have been discovered by the [Root.GetName] in one of the equatorial regions on [From.GetName]. It seems the elevator was intentionally severed at its counterweight beyond geostationary orbit, collapsing the massive cable on top of several major urban centers along the equator. Judging by the ruins, the resulting death toll must have been in the millions."
 precursor.16.desc:1 "Our archaeologists on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have managed to recover the partial remains of a star chart next to a broken segment of elevator cable. It was apparently used by captains in the Vultaum merchant marine, and it shows several of their most lucrative interstellar trade routes."
 precursor.20.desc:0 "Several large, perfectly circular lakes on the surface of [From.GetName] were caused by a series of massive antimatter explosions several million years ago. This [From.GetPlanetMoon] was inhabited by the Vultaum at that point, and the craters are all clustered in the region that housed their largest planetary settlements.\n\nOrbital bombardment has been ruled out by the science staff on the [Root.GetName], leading us to believe that these explosions were triggered by someone or something on the ground."
 precursor.21.desc:1 "The archaeologists on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have managed to recover an intact memory core from a terminal inside a crumbling medical facility. It contained some interesting statistics, such as the average natural Vultaum lifespan (roughly 270 years) and a list of their most common diseases."
 precursor.25.desc:0 "A thorough scan of §Y[From.GetName]§! has revealed a vast, artificially-constructed network of tunnels beneath the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface. Most of the tunnels have collapsed, and the crew of the [Root.GetName] believe they represent only a small portion of what was once a much larger subterranean Vultaum colony.\n\nThe main underground caverns were intentionally collapsed, crushing the Vultaum cities and their inhabitants under several million tons of rock."
 precursor.26.desc:1 "The archaeological dig on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has unearthed some remarkable fossilized Vultaum remains from one of the collapsed chambers closest to the surface. This has given our scientists a much clearer picture of what the Vultaum actually looked like."
 precursor.30.name:0 "Vultaum Gas Giant Facility"
 precursor.30.desc:0 "We have detected the partial remains of a gas mining station in orbit around [From.GetName] which appears Vultaum in origin. Its station-keeping thrusters were deliberately fired millions of years ago in an attempt to push the station directly into the gas giant, but a collision with an unknown object prevented this from happening."
 precursor.31.desc:0 "A mostly intact Vultaum space suit that previous looters had somehow overlooked has been recovered by our archaeologists. This four meter long, tube-like construct has given our scientists new insights into what kind of environments the Vultaum preferred."
 precursor.35.name:0 "Vultaum Trade Post"
 precursor.35.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! was home to a small Vultaum outpost where they traded with several neighboring civilizations. At some point the trade post appears to have been converted into a religious mission, where the Vultaum attempted to convert visiting alien merchants to their philosophy. Trade ceased shortly afterward, and the [From.GetPlanetMoon] was eventually abandoned."
 precursor.36.desc:1 "Archaeologists on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have salvaged a small Vultaum digital pamphlet. It seems the missionaries at this outpost passed pamphlets like this on to visiting merchants. Most of the data is corrupt, but there are several references to "the great lie" and "the shackles of virtual reality.""
 precursor.40.name:0 "Vultaum Satellite"
 precursor.40.desc:0 "A small Vultaum satellite was found in orbit of §Y[From.GetName]§!. It had been set up to continuously repeat a message until its power source drained millions of years ago. We salvaged its transmitter array but could only recover a small portion of the transmission.\n\nThe main purpose of this satellite was apparently to preach the dominant Vultaum philosophy to neighboring civilizations. Its message speaks of the need to "disconnect" and to "embrace true existence," whatever that means."
 precursor.41.desc:0 "After careful analysis of the Vultaum transmitter array, our archaeologists and data engineers have concluded that the machinery does not contain any technologies of value to us. The project has greatly improved our understanding of the primary Vultaum programming language, however. This will hopefully make it easier to decipher their data in the future."
 precursor.45.name:0 "Vultaum Splinter Colony"
 precursor.45.desc:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! was the site of a small Vultaum colony that is unique for two reasons - the [From.GetStarName] system is not within what used to be Vultaum space, and the ruins are several centuries younger than anything else left by their civilization. The colony seems to have been settled by some kind of splinter group that rejected their society's dominant philosophy."
 precursor.46.desc:1 "Several artifacts excavated at the archaeological dig site on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! are covered in writing that firmly rejects the Vultaum philosophical idea that "life itself is a lie." One of them appears to be a memorial of sorts to the Vultaum race as a whole. This would confirm our theory that this splinter colony existed for some time after the collapse of the rest of the Star Assembly."
 precursor.50.name:0 "Vultaum Virtual Reality Center"
 precursor.50.desc:0 "Vultaum engineers at some point built a massive orbital complex near §Y[From.GetName]§! dedicated to computer research. Strangely, they seem to have ignored the normally popular field of artificial intelligence to focus exclusively on virtual realities and massive computer simulations.

There is evidence elsewhere on the asteroid's surface indicating that it was heavily mined by the Vultaum at some point roughly 12 million years ago. The large crater we found was presumably the location of their mining outpost."

From the ruins that remain on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, we have learned that Vultaum society experienced a radical ideological shift a century before their extinction.\n\nTheir new philosophy posited that the entire universe was an artificial reality which all sapient beings had been unwittingly plugged into for the amusement of some higher power. The Vultaum undertook increasingly radical attempts to forcefully "disconnect" themselves from this simulation, most of which involved mass suicide.\n\nThey finally concluded that only the simultaneous disconnection of billions of individuals would destabilize the system enough to grant them freedom. At an agreed upon hour, Vultaum everywhere killed themselves by any means available. Those who refused to take part in this mass suicide were too few to repopulate the species, and so the Vultaum faded into obscurity and eventual extinction."

Our scientists think they inhabited this region of stars roughly six million years ago, based on the age of the artifacts. The aliens called themselves the "Yuht" and appear to have been very large and flat arthropod analogues.\n\nIt seems a single individual could reach a length of nearly a hundred meters as an adult, and it was apparently exceedingly rare for more than two or three Yuht to travel aboard the same starship.

 precursor.506.desc:1 "After extensive studies of §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, we now know that the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] served as one of several "hatchery worlds" in the Yuht Empire. Their Ministry of Breeding prepared worlds by sterilizing them of predators and other potentially harmful elements before planting eggs on the surface.\n\nThe Yuht hatchlings were then left on their own in this relatively safe environment for several centuries until they developed a level of near-sapience. Only then were they collected and carefully introduced into society."

 precursor.510.desc:0 "We have discovered several massive listening arrays on [From.GetName]. These arrays are millions of years old and we believe they were originally built by the Yuht, though it appears at least one other alien civilization repurposed them at some point in the last 500,000 years for their own needs. The colossal receiving dishes are beyond repair, but some terminals are still intact."

These are various artifacts collected by Yuht from throughout their empire, claimed to prove the existence of sapient alien life. In each case, the museum has debunked the artifacts as frauds."
 precursor.516.desc:1 "Most of the artifacts exhibited by the Yuht museums on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! are missing, but our archaeologists managed to recover one of these supposed frauds. It seems to be an instrument used for measuring cosmic radiation, but the archaeologists have confirmed that it predates the Yuht by several million years. Contrary to the opinion of the Yuht museum, this would indeed seem to be an authentic alien artifact."
 precursor.520.desc:0 "Signs of Yuht development can be found all across §Y[From.GetName]§!, and the [From.GetPlanetMoon] must have experienced limited terraforming at some point. One region in the northern hemisphere is some kind of massive graveyard. No Yuht settlements can be found nearby, but there are many monuments marking burial sites.\n\nWith a low birthrate and an average lifespan close to a thousand years, each Yuht death was treated as a significant event and much emphasis was placed on burial ceremonies."
 precursor.521.desc:1 "The archaeological digs on [From.From.GetName] have revealed that most of the graves were looted in the millions of years since they were first dug, likely as a result of the Yuht custom of burying their dead with jewelry and other extravagant gifts. In a pile of things discarded by the looters, the archaeologists found a large doll resembling an adult Yuht. They speculate that it may have served as a good luck charm or memento of some kind."
 precursor.525.desc:0 "A massive ground war was fought on §Y[From.GetName]§! between the Yuht and a second species that we know little of. This campaign took place in the final years of the Yuht Empire, and though it occurred millions of years ago, wreckage of ruined war machines can still be found.\n\nAlthough the [From.GetPlanetMoon] was an important Yuht colony, their cities and outlying settlements were never rebuilt after the fighting ceased, which would seem to indicate that they ultimately lost the campaign."
 precursor.526.desc:1 "After combing through several of the ancient battlefields on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, our archaeologists recovered what appears to be a Yuht battle harness. Several large-caliber cannons were still attached to it, and the archaeologists theorize that Yuht soldiers, given the massive size of their bodies, fought as what can essentially be described as large mobile fortresses."

This event occurred right here in the [From.GetStarName] system, and had a profound impact on all levels of Yuht society.\n\nFor over a million years they had thought themselves alone in the galaxy, and the Yuht reacted with both awe and horror upon the discovery of sapient alien life. The [Root.GetName] has recovered the satellite, which now awaits a full analysis."
 precursor.531.desc:1 "After analyzing the satellite we recovered above §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, our archaeologists found an ingrained, highly stylized picture of what appears to be a Yuht cruiser and a much smaller Jabbardeeni scout in close formation during the first contact event. This has given us some notion of what their starships looked like."

 precursor.536.desc:1 "The archaeologists investigating the derelict Yuht cruiser above §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have transmitted their report. There are two large cryo chambers in the cruiser's mid-section, designed to house one Yuht each in suspended animation. Given the massive size of Yuht individuals, this was apparently their standard crew complement on vessels of this size.\n\nNo Yuht remains were found anywhere on the ship, but the archaeologists managed to recover logs from a computer that monitored the life signs and medical condition of the crew. It has provided valuable data on Yuht physiology."

Twisted metal skeletons are all that remain of the massive arcologies that once covered the surface.\n\nFrom what we can piece together, it seems the Yuht spent the better part of a million years searching local space in vain for signs of intelligent alien life. When they finally encountered the Jabbardeeni, a young race that had only recently achieved interstellar travel, their alien psychology was a tremendous shock.\n\nThe Yuht leadership reached a consensus: the Jabbardeeni had to be eradicated before they grew too powerful. A massive surprise attack was launched, which was beaten back at great cost for both sides. Despite their young age, the Jabbardeeni were already experimenting with technologies the Yuht had never considered, and eventually they gained the upper hand.

Massive hive-like cities once covered most of the surface, but we have learned that the Khamdai banned all construction in a large circular region extending across more than a third of the southern hemisphere. This area served as both a mating ground and nature reserve."
 precursor.1016.desc:1 "Our archaeological expedition to §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has learned much about the now-extinct Khamdai. They were a warrior culture that fought several wars against many of the other First League founders soon after their first starships breached the light barrier.\n\nAfter meeting with defeat, the Khamdai became an enthusiastic supporter of the First League's founding and many of their finest warriors would go on to serve as shock troops against the League's enemies.

They were reptilian, with elongated and legless bodies that could be twenty meters or longer in adult individuals.\n\nAll surviving accounts indicate that the Chassago were expert traders, and their trade barges were often the first point of contact between non-affiliated races and the First League. It is doubtful whether it could have expanded as rapidly as it did without the benefit of the extensive Chassago trade network that already existed before its foundation."

The population was clustered into hundreds of massive arcologies spread out across the surface, each capable of supporting several hundred million individuals.\n\nThese arcologies were connected by a network of skyways, and the Migir-Yan were evidently content to leave the rest of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s wilderness untouched."
 precursor.1026.desc:1 "Fossilized remains of the extinct Migir-Yan have been recovered by our archaeologists on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, allowing us to paint a clearer picture of what this species looked like. Unusually small, with most individuals being no taller than 0.6 meters, these mammalian rodent analogues were herbivores.\n\nMigir-Yan family units often consisted of close to a thousand individuals, and an individual's station in society depended almost exclusively on their social skills. The Migir-Yan diplomatic corps is believed to have been the driving force behind the creation of the First League."

These flightless bird analogues walked on long, spindly legs and fossilized remains suggest that their females could reach heights of up to four meters, while males were slightly smaller.\n\nAll of their cities were built inside hollowed out mesas. Scans indicate that some of these mesas were artificially constructed, presumably by the V'ropak themselves after they ran out of natural candidates to build new cities within."
 precursor.1031.desc:1 "When the First League was at the zenith of its power, the V'ropak were renowned as the best scientists in the galaxy. Their research innovations drove the League's initial expansion phase, and more than one species was brought into the fold by promises of access to V'ropak technology.

All evidence recovered so far points towards this having been some sort of research base built by the First League."
 precursor.1036.desc:1 "The archaeological expedition we sent to §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has returned. Very little remained of the First League research base they were sent to investigate, but judging by its isolated location, we suspect that the research conducted there was of a dangerous nature - possibly involving dimensional travel or advanced bio-weapons.\n\nA recovered data disc from the "Academy of Sciences" has offered some insights into how the scientific community of the First League was organized."

It was abandoned less than fifty years after its founding."
 precursor.1041.desc:1 "Our archaeologists have learned more about the lost colony on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!. At its founding, the First League was already on the verge of collapse and the colony was meant to serve as a propaganda tool - a model world where all League members were represented and worked together in harmony.\n\nThis effort appears to have backfired, as there is evidence of significant infighting between the colonists, including a large massacre that occurred just before the colony was abandoned."
 precursor.1045.name:0 "League Trade Center"
 precursor.1045.desc:0 "Two million years ago, §Y[From.GetName]§! served as a major trading hub for the member nations of the First League. Large portions of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface was covered in towering cities, and we have identified the ruins of at least twelve major spaceports in the northern hemisphere alone. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] was gradually abandoned over a period of several centuries, presumably as a result of shifting trade routes and the collapse of the First League."
 precursor.1046.desc:1 "It is unclear which species first settled this world - bones and fossilized remains from all known First League member species have been found on the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] in nearly equal amounts.

 precursor.1051.desc:1 "Our archaeologists have successfully excavated several starship hulls on the surface of §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, relics from the massive space battle that took place in this system two million years ago. The forces involved were the 2nd and 3rd Fleets of the First League Grand Navy, fighting to contain an incursion by the combined fleets of the Rikim, a nomadic warrior species from the galactic rim.\n\nWhat began as a minor skirmish quickly escalated into a running fleet battle involving hundreds of ships on both sides. It is impossible to tell which side won."

As a federal facility, the prison housed convicted felons from across all of League space.\n\nSurviving records indicate most of the prisoners were guilty of piracy, terrorism and other crimes of "extraordinary nature." Fossilized remains from some prisoners can still be found where the cells used to be."
 precursor.1056.desc:1 "The archaeological mission to §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has uncovered evidence of what appears to be a failed escape attempt some distance south of the prison complex. A toppled utility vehicle from the prison was found behind a small cliff, and several kilometers beyond that the remains of several prisoners in stolen pressure suits were huddled together.\n\nThey seem to have died of asphyxiation when the oxygen supply in their suits ran out. For whatever reason, the prison authorities evidently saw no reason to collect the bodies."

Interestingly, the [Root.GetName] has also found evidence of hidden observation posts on the [From.GetPlanetMoon] that were built by the First League. It would appear that they studied the primitive aliens while making an effort to avoid cultural contamination.\n\nMost of the observation posts were destroyed by advanced energy weapons, and we have found nothing yet to explain why the primitive civilization never advanced beyond the Bronze Age."
 precursor.1061.desc:1 "From our archaeological findings on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, we have learned that the First League maintained a clear policy not to interfere in the development of pre-space civilizations. Hidden observation posts like the ones we found on this [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] were maintained on at least seven worlds throughout League space.\n\nThis particular civilization appears to have met its end when a band of slavers invaded during the power vacuum that resulted from the First League's collapse."

Orbital debris indicate that the blockades were violently challenged several times."
 precursor.1066.desc:1 "A team of archaeologists found the wreckage of a First League destroyer on the surface of §Y[From.From.GetName]§!. It must have been part of the orbital blockade, and seems to have gone down when the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s native aliens detonated a hidden antimatter device on a captured blockade runner.

As on other Irassian worlds, the fossilized remains tell a harrowing tale - the population rapidly succumbed to the Javorian Pox, and there appears to have been widespread panic in all of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s major settlements. There is also an unusually large amount of debris in orbit, possibly the remnants of a battle."
 precursor.1506.desc:1 "We have analyzed the orbital debris, and our archaeologists conclude that §Y[From.From.GetName]§! was subjected to a military blockade before and during the Irassian colony's demise.

A molluscoid species that was on the verge of achieving space flight when the Irassians discovered them, the Joggra were conquered after a lengthy military campaign that devastated many of their cities.\n\nThere is evidence on the surface that a sizeable Irassian military garrison was stationed there for decades afterwards, suggesting that the Joggra were not content to remain under the Irassian yoke."

They were winged arthropoids, and recovered fossils suggest they were capable of at least limited flight - what little we have seen of their surviving architecture supports this theory.\n\nUnfortunately, there are few remains of this civilization, as the [From.GetPlanetMoon] seems to have been subjected to a massive orbital bombardment."
 precursor.1521.desc:1 "Our study of the alien ruins on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has offered us new insights into the final moments of the Irassian Concordat. The Irassians believed that the Ti'Derg were part of a plot together with several of the Concordat's other client species to deliberately spread the Javorian Pox to Irassian worlds.\n\nWhether this was true or not we will likely never know, but the Irassian fleet felt the evidence was compelling enough to incinerate the entire [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] from orbit."

Given their age, the ruins found so far on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface are in fairly good condition. There are no signs of orbital bombardment or armed conflict.\n\nThe Irassian colonists appear to have succumbed to the Javorian Pox, after which the aggressive native flora reclaimed the lifeless cities and hid them under a dense layer of vegetation."
 precursor.1526.desc:1 "After clearing away the vegetation from one of the ancient Irassian settlements on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! and setting up energy field generators to keep predators at bay, our archaeologists conducted a thorough excavation of the ruins. We now have a much better understanding of what daily life in Irassian society was like.\n\nAmong the most valuable finds is a digital atlas, apparently used to teach Irassian children about their empire. It also contains detailed and disparaging descriptions of all of the Concordat's subjugated client species."

 precursor.1531.desc:1 "After investigating the boreholes on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, our archaeologists found the fossilized remains of over a hundred Irassian miners at the bottom of one of them. They appear to be more victims of the Javorian Pox that brought about the fall of the Irassian Concordat. In a futile attempt to keep the disease from spreading, their comrades dumped the bodies down one of the boreholes before the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] was evacuated."

All evidence points conclusively towards this unassuming [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] having been the origin of the Javorian Pox!\n\nA rare form of native bacteria invaded the Irassian colony due to a manufacturing flaw in a quarantine seal, and from there it spread to the air filters of a visiting merchant ship.

Artifacts recovered amongst the debris have confirmed that this space station served as the headquarters of the Irassian Concordat's Authority of Disease Control some 1.2 million years ago.\n\nThe Irassians were far more susceptible to alien diseases than most known species, and the budget of their public health institute nearly rivaled that of their military. Despite this, surviving records show that their entire species perished from the Javorian Pox."
 precursor.1546.desc:1 "We have recovered the remnants of several research logs from the debris field above §Y[From.From.GetName]§!. Their final entries are all focused on finding a cure for the Javorian Pox that was sweeping across the Irassian Concordat, and they grow increasingly desperate as the situation worsened.\n\nThe last entry reveals that the pox had spread in an uncontrolled fashion on the space station itself.

It is equipped with an array of powerful sensors that seem to be aimed towards neighboring systems. None of them are functional, and the asteroid appears to have been gone over and looted at least once by another party."
 precursor.1551.desc:1 "We have learned that the Irassians used the listening post on asteroid [From.From.GetName] to spy and plan attacks on neighboring civilizations during the expansionist phase of their empire. These attacks met with dramatic success, and the Irassians soon became the dominant power in this section of the galaxy. By the time they were decimated by the Javorian Pox, this listening post had long since been abandoned by the Irassian military."

Recovered logs make references to some kind of artificial object floating deep inside the gas giant's crushing atmosphere.\n\nThe [Root.GetName] has found no trace of such an object despite repeated atmospheric scans, so either the Irassians finally managed to retrieve it or someone else did in the countless years since their demise."

Someone has relatively recently (within the last 2,000 years) gone through the trouble of systematically bombarding every square meter of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface from orbit - possibly a misguided attempt to keep the Javorian Pox from resurfacing.\n\nDespite this, the surface is still covered in the fossilized remains of the billions of Irassians who succumbed to the plague in the final years of their empire. By the time it had spread to their homeworld, most of the worlds in the Irassian Concordat had already fallen, and their alien vassals were in open revolt.\n\nJudging by ancient satellite logs recovered from orbit, the mood among the population on the Irassian homeworld was largely resigned by this point. The widespread panic that accompanied the first outbreaks of the pox on the colonies was largely absent, as most had come to accept the fact that the end was drawing near."

Incredibly, this civilization, which apparently referred to itself as the "Cybrex," seems to have been made up of machines that were linked together in some sort of collective consciousness. The age of the artifacts indicate they were active some 600,000 years ago - in this portion of the galaxy at least - but we have learned nothing of their exact origins.\n\nAccording to a partial data fragment that our scientists managed to extract from one of the artifacts, the Cybrex at some point launched a crusade to destroy all sapient organic life in the galaxy for reasons unknown."

Some kind of sapient machine was created by the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s original inhabitants, the Kuur. Although the details of how it happened are unknown to us, this eventually resulted in the birth of a massive communal machine consciousness - the Cybrex.\n\nAt some point they turned on the Kuur, butchering the population of their homeworld in a brief but destructive war that all but destroyed the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s biosphere. The systematic elimination of Kuur colonies in neighboring systems followed, until their civilization had ceased to be."

The [From.GetPlanetMoon] was bombarded from orbit until the Indimak offered their surrender. Cybrex warforms then descended to the surface, initiating a program to exterminate the Indimak population that would last for three years.\n\nAlong with seven billion Indimak, this also resulted in the destruction of an estimated 97% of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s biota."
 precursor.2011.desc:1 "The biosphere of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! has only now started recovering from the Cybrex invasion 600,000 years ago. We have found the overgrown ruins of a Cybrex factory, where Indimak slaves were forced to assist in the demise of their own species by building war machines. When their extermination program was reaching completion, the Cybrex "disassembled" the remaining slave workers and dismantled the factories.\n\nAlthough they initially maintained a significant mining operation on the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon], the Cybrex appear to have later withdrawn from the entire system for unknown reasons."

 precursor.2016.desc:1 "After studying the wreckage of the two Cybrex warforms over §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has concluded that they were most likely destroyed while fighting each other. This theory explains the lack of non-Cybrex debris, and it fits the damage patterns found on the wrecks.\n\nWhy the two Cybrex vessels turned on each other remains a mystery, however. After they were immobilized, both warforms triggered some kind of self-destruct mechanism that fried their neural processors."

The name of the alien species that fought against them has not survived the passage of time, but they seem to have put up stiff resistance. Broken Cybrex war machines can be found all over the [From.From.From.GetPlanetMoon], and debris from their invasion fleet still drifts in orbit."
 precursor.2021.desc:1 "After their initial invasion of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! stalemated due to the unexpected tenacity of the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s defenders, the Cybrex seem to have withdrawn back into orbit to reconsider their options.\n\nTheir solution to the problem was to maneuver two large asteroids on a collision course with the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]. The impacts destroyed most of the industries and infrastructure the Cybrex had calculated on subverting for their own use, but this was deemed a necessary sacrifice to break the stalemate."

For whatever reason, the asteroid was left behind when the rest of the Cybrex vanished from the galaxy. It remained functional for at least 50,000 years after their disappearance, despite increasingly erratic behavior from its administrative AI.\n\nAfter more than five trillion failed attempts to connect with the Cybrex subspace hub, the AI appears to have suicided by short-circuiting all of the asteroid's systems."

At first, we thought it was simply missing its connection with the rest of its kind, until our Telepaths told us that it had been in communication with them, speaking of a 'Hole in the Void'.\n\nWhat it meant by this we found out only when a team of scientists researching Prethoryn intergalactic travel methods discovered a discrepancy in our astronomical database. While charting the likely path the Prethoryn had been following, they found that a small spiral galaxy some 30 million light-years distant from our own was... missing.\n\nThe galaxy, discovered and studied during the early space era of our species, is simply no longer emanating any form of light observable by our instruments. This bizarre and unexpected discovery sent our scientists into a scramble to try and explain what could cause an entire galaxy to simply vanish from the sky.\n\nTwo explanations emerged: Either the stars of the galaxy simply went out, all at once, or there is something, something so vast as to eclipse an entire galaxy, blocking its light from reaching us. Both theories seem equally implausible, and many have simply decried them as ludicrous, preferring to think that the missing galaxy never existed at all, invented by some erroneous use of a primitive telescope.

Having carefully considered what an appropriate punishment for insulting the [Root.GetSpeciesName] might be, only death and complete destruction seemed like a suitable option.\n\nUnrepentant into [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetHerHis] last moments, the defiant admiral's passionate speech about our savage ways was cut short by the airlock closing as the pod was launched at near lightspeed into the heart of [Root.Capital.StarName].

They've responded with a message largely trying to excuse the admiral's behavior, in the process suggesting, perhaps inadvertently, that some of what [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetSheHe] said about [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] might have rung true.\n\nWhat we assumed to be the actions of one bigot has turned out to be acceptable in [From.GetName].

What if they are mapping the genomes of unsuspecting [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] with the intention of finding our weaknesses?
