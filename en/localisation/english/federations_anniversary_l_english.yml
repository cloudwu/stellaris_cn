Etched records speak of councils who would 'channel' these energies in order to guide their empire's fortunes.\n\nSuch observances did not halt their society's eventual decline, but in the millennia which followed there also came an inheritor who would translate and revive the practice. They too have since left these sites, for parts unknown.\n\nThe vast timepiece has slowly ticked on through the periods of at least two civilizations; its automated siren has now called on us to observe this ritual at sites across our region of space.

Recently, several influential military experts from across the federation have raised concerns about our ability to face a well-coordinated and powerful enemy.\n\nTo rectify this, they have drawn up plans for a federation-wide series of military exercises to build cohesion within our militaries and hone the skills of our crews. Under their plans, detachments from each of our fleets would move to specific locations in our allies' territories and perform a series of complex maneuvers, coordinating with other participating fleets to ensure that the operations are executed simultaneously. Successfully holding these exercises would be a significant commitment for our armed forces but would appreciably boost our federation's military readiness."
