spires_of_light_category: "Spires of Light"
spires_of_light_category_desc: "Initial scans reveal a series of towering, luminescent structures rising from an otherwise unremarkable landscape. Their origin and purpose remain unclear, but their spectral glow suggests something more than a natural phenomenon."
infernals.500.name: "$spires_of_light_category$"
infernals.500.desc: "Probes dispatched to investigate the glowing pillars have determined they are formed from a malleable silicate magma. This material is forced upward through bedrock vents, solidifying before it breaches the surface. The resulting structures can grow hundreds of meters tall before their weight causes them to collapse.\n\nThe result is a veritable forest of spires composed of nearly pure, transparent volcanic glass, each one refracting the warm orange glow of the molten magma still churning below.\n\nScientist [Leader.GetName] posits that the remnants of these collapsed spires could serve as a valuable resource."
#EXCELLENT:0 (first option has default answer)
infernals.500.a: "Leave this divine place in peace."
infernals.500.b: "Place a bid on an extraction permit."
infernals.500.c: "Use them for target practice."

lava_whirlpool_category: "Lava Whirlpool"
lava_whirlpool_category_desc: "The first survey of [Planet.GetName] revealed a strange storm-like shape in the planet's main lava ocean. This phenomenon is highly unusual, and bears investigating."
infernals.56.name: "Lava Whirlpool"
infernals.56.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has confirmed the strange shape to be a lava whirlpool. These are exceedingly rare, and none of this size has ever been recorded. Struck by the strange phenomenon, [Leader.GetName] ordered a sampling mission.\n\nThe samples reveal that the whirlpool is in part sustained by a steady pool of Living Metal, which is torn apart by the currents and then attempts to reconstitute itself. That reconstitution further disturbs the lava, continuing the whirlpool's motion. The sampling also demonstrates that this Living Metal could be harvested with little effort."
infernals.56.a: "Begin harvesting operations."

outgassing_category: "Outgassing"
outgassing_category_desc: "A routine scan of [Planet.GetName] noted unusually strong chemical fluctuations in the atmosphere. A closer survey may explain what is happening here."
infernals.1001.name: "Outgassing"
infernals.1001.desc: "Chemical fluctuations in the atmosphere were confirmed across both time and the surface. The fluctuations were strongest over the planet's large ocean of exposed magma, so a probe was dispatched to collect samples.\n\nUpon closer analysis, [Leader.GetName] determined that the magma ocean on [Planet.GetName] is outgassing valuable exotic gasses. This unexpected finding suggests that the planet could be a potential contributor to our industries, if we are able to exploit it."
infernals.1001.a: "Begin extraction procedures."

crystal_lava_lakes_category: "Crystal Lava Lakes"
crystal_lava_lakes_category_desc: "This planet appears to have large pools of free-flowing lava on its surface. These are worth investigating, in case they present opportunities for resource harvesting."
infernals.1002.name: "Crystal Lava Lakes"
infernals.1002.desc: "Our first images from the surface of [Planet.GetName] have revealed stunning and unexpected geological formations that are being called 'crystal lava lakes'. These long-lived bodies of magma are infused with unique minerals that, within a specific temperature range, naturally self-arrange into crystalline matrices. The result is exceptional transparency and red-spectrum iridescence across the lake. Due to the planet's orbit, this visually striking effect ebbs and flows on a seasonal cycle as temperatures fluctuate.\n\nThe aesthetic appeal of these crystal lava lakes could prove to be a powerful draw for tourists. The crystalline minerals themselves could also be skimmed from the surface during their active season, after which their properties could be leveraged for energy storage media."
infernals.1002.a: "Develop the site as a resort"
infernals.1002.b: "Harvest energy from the lakes"
crystal_lava_resort: "Crystal Lava Resort"
crystal_lava_resort_desc: "The visually stunning lakes on this planet have been developed into a luxury tourist destination, drawing visitors from across the galaxy."

bioadaptive_flora_category: "Bioadaptive Flora"
bioadaptive_flora_category_desc: "While [Planet.GetName] appears to be a typical volcanic wasteland, the oxygen content is strangely high. Something unusual must be producing that oxygen."
infernals.1003.name: "Bioadaptive Flora"
infernals.1003.desc: "Initial assessment of [Planet.GetName] characterized it as a world of magma and fire, but surveys have revealed a native ecosystem of complex flora inhabiting a network of rift valleys across the planet. These plants produce oxygen and collect what little moisture exists, resulting in pockets of almost temperate microclimates in an otherwise superheated wasteland.\n\nThe biomes supported by this flora could prove habitable for species that otherwise avoid settling volcanic worlds, and the flora itself may be suitable for agriculture. It would benefit any settlers to thoroughly explore what exactly lives in those canyons."
infernals.1003.a: "Mark area as viable settlement zone"
infernals.1003.tooltip_a: "Adds a planetary modifier improving Habitability Tolerance and Growth."
bioadaptive_flora_modifier: "Bioadaptive Flora"
bioadaptive_flora_modifier_desc: "A resilient native flora covers this planet's rift valleys, creating cooler, breathable microclimates and supporting limited habitability even in a volcanic environment."

tectonic_icebreaker_category: "Tectonic Icebreaker"
tectonic_icebreaker_category_desc: "Strange low-temperature anomalies were detected in the regolith of [Planet.GetName], suggesting that some process or object may be cooling parts of the surface. A drilling expedition would reveal more."
infernals.1004.name: "Tectonic Icebreaker"
infernals.1004.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports that beneath the volcanic surface of §Y[from.GetName]§! are vast glaciers. They are encased in unusual rock formations composed of minerals with exceptional insulating properties. Tectonic activity is slowly degrading these insulating layers, and [Leader.GetName] predicts that if temperatures between the glaciers and the rest of the planet were to equalize, the planet would cool enough to be considered an arid world, rather than a volcanic one.\n\nWe can speed up this process in order to make the planet somewhat more habitable. But the phenomenon is scientifically curious, and there may be value in allowing it to be studied as it proceeds naturally."
infernals.1004.a: "Stabilize the tectonics"
infernals.1004.b: "Accelerate the melting"

infernal_oasis_category: "Infernal Oasis"
infernal_oasis_category_desc: "Startling images of §Y[from.GetName]§! show a burning, molten world interrupted by a startlingly bright, continent-sized swathe of green. This exceptional sight suggests something highly unusual on the surface."
infernals.505.name: "A haven between cataclysm"
infernals.505.desc: "The unique composition and tectonics of §Y[from.GetName]§! has created an unparalleled marvel. While most of the planet is a hot desert clogged with volcanic smog and free-flowing lava, one massive continental plate of solid rock rises dozens of kilometers above the average surface. The resulting highlands, high above the layer of toxic clouds, are home to a verdant green ecosystem of native plants and animals.\n\nThis plateau would be readily habitable for many species and could hold a number of fascinating scientific insights if it were to be studied."
infernals.505.a: "An astonishing discovery."

mysterious_ringing_category: "Mysterious Ringing"
mysterious_ringing_category_desc: "Our scientists have detected regular radiowave spikes from a single point on [Planet.GetName]. They appear to coincide with the time at which the source of the signal crosses from night into day."
infernals.3210.name: "Mysterious Ringing"
infernals.3210.desc: "A science team arrived on [from.GetName] to track down the signal, and determined that it was coming from an underground cave system outfitted with scientific observation equipment.\n\n[Leader.GetName] led the team into the caverns, where they found a chamber sealed off by unfamiliar alloys, with a faint ringing coming from within. [GetMysteriousRingingDesc3210]\n\nOnce audioprotective equipment was issued, the team entered and found a creature of unknown species hibernating next to the source of the signal: an odd cylindrical device.\n\nAnalysis determined the device emits regular radio bursts, followed by several hours of melodic noise overlaid with vocalizations, which appear compatible with the creature's vocal anatomy. [Leader.GetName] speculates the device may be trying to rouse the creature in accordance with a set schedule."
infernals.3210.individual: "The survey team found a weakness in the seal and broke through, at which point the ringing became deafening, causing panic attacks and fits of rage among the team."
infernals.3210.gestalt: "The survey team found a weakness in the seal and broke through, at which point the ringing became deafening, causing sensory overload and cognitive breakdown among drones."

# Red Giant Origin
infernals.45.name: "Concerning Trends"
infernals.45.desc: "We have long thought of §Y[capital_star.GetName]§! as a typical red giant, but recent analysis indicates that its size and radiation emissions are increasing. These changes are already having a measurable effect on our climate and the population is growing alarmed.\n\nThe trends show no sign of stopping. If our species is to survive, we must investigate the cause of this phenomenon."

infernals.50.totalIgnorance: "Whatever caused the Red Giant calamity is no longer relevant, all we can do now is accept our current state and rebuild from what is left."
infernals.50.semiIgnorance: "Disruptions by the stellar blast wiped out any evidence needed to track the culprit down.\n\nAll we can do now is accept our current state and rebuild from what is left."
infernals.50.defaultEnding: "The process begun by a remnant population of aliens in a degraded mining station has finally reached its conclusion: §Y[Target.GetStarName]§! went nova, after engulfing nearly the whole system. Technicolor plasma and radiation scoured §Y[event_target:red_giant_homeworld_tmp.GetName]§! clean, along with the rest of our home system.\n\n[GetMegacorpDesc50]\n\n[GetLususMiningDesc]"
infernals.50.megacorp: "Our homeworld has been converted into a vast field of mineral wealth, spread across the system for convenient access. The cost of mining these resources is far less than it would have been if they had remained inside their respective planets and moons. We can expect our profits to soar thanks to this cheap supply of resources."
infernals.50.nonmegacorp: "While our homeworld is now a wasteland, the nova exposed a treasure trove of mineral resources across the entire system that can be easily accessed by conventional mining equipment. This wealth can be used to build a new future."
infernals.50.lususExists: "The station flickers with one last pulse of energy before shutting down, leaving us alone to pick up the pieces of our homeworld."
infernals.50.lususGone: "Since the station no longer exists, §Y[event_target:red_giant_homeworld_tmp.GetName]§! can rest easy knowing it can never happen again."
infernals.50.a: "We must do whatever we can to restore our home."
infernals.51.name: "Nova Mitigated"
infernals.51.desc: "After monumental cleanup efforts, the surface of §Y[this.GetName]§! is survivable for $trait_infernal_plural$ again. While some permanent scars will always remain, they can now be leveraged to their full potential for unique research opportunities."
infernals.60.name: "Return to Normal"
infernals.60.desc: "By adjusting the siphon, extracting hydrogen from the shell, and fine-tuning the star's input ratios, we have safely reversed §Y[Target.GetStarName]§!'s expansion, restoring it to its former calm as a warm Red Giant.\n\nWe have already detected climatic stabilization on §Y[Target.GetStarName]§!, and we can look forward to a more habitable future in which our home planet continues to be the heart of our empire.\n\n[GetRedGiantEndingKalmStationStatus]"
infernals.60.lususDestroyed: "Without the station in our [Owner.Species.GetHandNamePlural], we may never understand precisely what happened, but we can make the most of any materials released by the star as it receded."
infernals.60.lususAlive: "Now that we understand how to control this station, we can decide how it will be used next."
infernals.60.a: "Dismantle the station."
infernals.60.b: "Maintain our study of the station."
infernals.60.c: "Let it be a monument to our victory."
infernals.60.d: "Relief at last."
infernals.65.name: "Stellar Expansion"
infernals.65.desc: "Ongoing observations confirm that §Y[Target.system_star.GetName]§! is expanding at an accelerating pace. Physical effects from the increased radiation are also being reported. Unless we can find a way to stop it, §Y[Target.system_star.GetName]§! will eradicate us long before it consumes the planet.\n\n[GetMegacorpDesc65]"
infernals.65.nonmegacorp: "Protecting against stellar radiation can buy us more time. A more hazardous but potentially lucrative scheme would be to harness the increased radiation, boosting our energy and industrial sectors."
infernals.65.megacorp: "An investment in planetary protection would act as insurance against volatility, and would help secure our asset base. But we might be able to boost our energy and industrial metrics if we pivot to harnessing the increased radiation instead."
infernals.65.a: "Protect our homeworld."
infernals.65.b: "Exploit the phenomenon."
infernals.70.name: "A Hungry Star"
infernals.70.desc: "§Y[Target.GetName]§! has claimed its first major victim, engulfing the innermost world of our system. Although the raw materials still exist, they now lie beyond our reach in the fiery depths of the star.\n\nWhile we can weather the immediate economic loss, this provides a frightening glimpse of what awaits §Y[Owner.Capital.GetName]§!."
infernals.75.name: "Collateral Damage"
infernals.75.desc: "Our Red Giant's unprecedented growth has now consumed another planet. Its rich resources will remain forever inaccessible, unless the star sheds its outer layers in a violent nova."
infernals.95.name: "Stellar Tunneling"
infernals.95.desc: "The truth about §Y[capital_star.GetName]§! is stranger than we imagined. Ongoing investigations have revealed a twinned pair of subspace tunnels deep within our star.\n\nOne of these channels hydrogen-rich material directly into the outer shell, accelerating fusion and increasing helium production. This should drive core compression, but the second tunnel actively siphons energy, counteracting the process. The result is the expansion of the star.\n\nInitial telemetry from both subspace tunnels suggests they connect to multiple endpoints scattered across the galaxy. Our survival depends on investigating these as soon as possible."
infernals.95.a: "We'll need to investigate three of these locations."
infernals.95.a.tt: "Viable targets for triangulation of the subspace origin have been located."
infernals.105.name: "Subspace Scarring"
infernals.105.desc: "Astrometric scans around §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§! revealed unexplained subspace scarring. While there is currently no exit point at this location, a past tunnel may have opened in orbit around this gas giant. The data has provided physics insights that could be applied in other areas. \n\nIn the meantime, we will have to look elsewhere to determine the source of the subspace tunnels at work within our star."
infernals.105.a: "Keep looking."
infernals.110.name: "Alien Scrap Metal"
infernals.110.desc: "The scans around §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§! indicate subspace scarring. We have also identified pockets of ancient scrap metal near the planet. These are orbitally locked into position, and may be related to the scarring. \n\nOngoing scans of these subspace fluctuations should help us to optimize the solar arrays around our home star.\n\nWhile this data has been helpful, we need at least one more survey location to lock down the present source of our problems."
infernals.110.a: "Auction off the scrap metal."
infernals.115.name: "Triangulation Complete"
infernals.115.desc: "At last, a real breakthrough.\n\nFurther scarring around §Y[FromFromFrom.GetName]§! allowed us to triangulate the origin of our star's disturbance to a previously undetected system with hostile signatures.\n\nThis investigation may eventually help us to counteract whatever is affecting our star.\n\nOnce we advance into the §YLusus§! system, we may be able to change the fate of §Y[FromFromFromFrom.Target.solar_system.GetName]§!, and of our civilization."
infernals.115.a: "Approach with caution."
infernals.115.b: "Prepare a show of force."
infernals.115.c: "Perform a blessing before approaching."
red_giant_lusus_triangulated_tt: "A new system is revealed."
infernals.2115.name: "Boarding Party"
infernals.2115.desc: "Our forces have seized control of the station. The inhabitants put up some resistance, but were poorly armed and seemingly untrained in warfare. Upon closer inspection, many appeared to be juveniles. Those who were not killed have been contained.\n\nAnalysis has begun on how we can control the subspace tunnels, which appear to be some sort of energy-mining siphon. With time, we can address the situation in our home system."
infernals.2115.a: "Demolish it."
infernals.2115.b: "Interrogate the survivors."

infernals.2121.name: "Aliens Terminated"
infernals.2121.desc: "The subspace mining station has been destroyed, killing everyone on board.\n\nThe destruction of the station detonated some unknown energy storage medium. The resulting energy rushed through the collapsing subspace tunnel into §Y[event_target:situation_red_giant_target_shortterm.GetStarName]§!, substantially worsening the situation back home.\n\nThat said, the transfer of hydrogen into our star has ceased. As bad as things may be, they will no longer worsen. While we may never know the origins or design of this station, we can at least rest easy knowing that such power will never fall to our rivals.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no immediate way to return §Y[event_target:situation_red_giant_target_shortterm.GetStarName]§! to its original state. If we want to affect the star's state, we'll need to rely on our recordings to piece together what the station was doing."
infernals.2121.a: "Let's clean up this mess."
infernals.2122.name: "Station Destroyed"
infernals.2122.desc: "As the station's remains drift through space, its destruction offers us a new chance to change the fate of §Y[event_target:situation_red_giant_target_shortterm.GetStarName]§!, not with the flip of a switch, but through hard, costly labor."
infernals.2125.name: "Alien Negotiations"
infernals.2125.desc: "After a lengthy and difficult process, we have a rudimentary translator that can communicate with station inhabitants.\n\nThe station has been operating for generations, moving from gas giant to gas giant, using the subspace siphon to extract energy from distant stars to power their life support and powerful jump drive.\n\nThe aliens do not fully understand the systems they are operating and did not realize that their siphoning targeted stars and eventually destroyed them.\n\nDespite their confusion, they seem eager to leave the station. They have promised to teach us what they know in exchange for a safe place to live and raise their young."
infernals.2125.a: "Provide them with sanctuary."
infernals.2125.b: "Give them a ship to find their own path."
infernals.2125.c: "Remotely vent the station."
infernals.2125.d: "Allow them to make their own judgment of us."
infernals.2130.name: "Subspace Mining Operation"
infernals.2130.desc: "The station siphons hydrogen from a gas giant and channels it through subspace into our star's shell. The resulting helium fusion releases excess energy, which is converted into §Y$entropy_crystals$§! to power the station.\n\nThe instability of §Y[event_target:situation_red_giant_target_shortterm.GetStarName]§! is a result of calibration errors and equipment degradation that the inhabitants either didn't notice or didn't know how to fix. \n\nWorking with their ancient technology we can reverse the process, but it will not be easy. Alternatively, forcing our star to go nova could expose countless deposits transforming our heritage into a trove of exploitable resources."
infernals.2130.a: "It's time to get to work."
infernals.2131.desc: "The station siphons hydrogen from a gas giant and channels it through subspace into our star's shell. The resulting helium fusion releases excess energy, which is converted into §Y$entropy_crystals$§! to power the station.\n\nThe inhabitants of the station retain only a warped oral tradition about its operations. They lost contact with their home civilization thousands of years ago, perhaps because that civilization collapsed or was destroyed. A buildup of calibration errors and equipment degradation has led to the increasingly unstable siphoning that now threatens to destroy §Y[event_target:situation_red_giant_target_shortterm.GetStarName]§!.\n\nWorking with their ancient technology we can reverse the process, but it will not be easy. Alternatively, forcing our star to go nova could expose countless deposits, transforming our heritage into a trove of exploitable resources."
infernals.2135.name: "An End to the Threat"
infernals.2135.desc: "Upon learning of our plight, the station's inhabitants expressed alarm and dismay. They believed themselves alone, and were unaware of other species in the galaxy.\n\nIn a fit of remorse and before we truly grasped what they were doing, they began to dismantle the station, permanently destroying most of its components.\n\nAs a result, it will be difficult to control the star's expansion. And we must decide what to do with these volatile aliens, and whether to offer them the forgiveness they desire."
infernals.2135.a: "Take them in and salvage the station."
infernals.2135.b: "Dispose of them and of the station."
infernals.2135.c: "Enslave them and destroy the station."

infernals.2140.desc: "After great effort, we now hold full control over the fate of §Y[event_target:situation_red_giant_target_shortterm.GetStarName]§!. Left alone, it would follow its natural life cycle at its current size.\n\nBut the ancient and failing station cannot withstand repeated reconfigurations. Each adjustment strains the facility to its limits. Now, we have only one choice.\n\nWe can shrink the star back to its former size, or force it to expand, transforming the system into a vast field of easily harvested resources.\n\nOur [GetScientistPlural] will attempt one last reconfiguration. After that, the only way forward will be rapid disassembly, by external force."

It will remain as it is now for millions of years, and our people can once again enjoy stability and predictability in our home system.\n\nOur star's increased size has clear consequences for how we manage our infrastructure, and we can now make the most of these changes, exploiting its increased energetic output while maintaining a viable presence in the system."
infernals.2145.a: "At last, we control our destiny."
infernals.2151.name: "A Mysterious Station"
infernals.2151.desc: "Upon entering the system, our vessels encountered limited resistance from a group of automated drones. These were swiftly neutralized, allowing for a closer examination of the alien station.\n\nThe structure remains operational, though its hull bears the marks of extensive patchwork repairs. Attempting to access one of its docking bays, we made contact with a previously unknown alien species. Though linguistic barriers remain, we have confirmed that this installation is the origin of the tunnels affecting §Y[event_target:situation_red_giant_target_shortterm.GetStarName]§!.\n\nEfforts are now underway to establish communications. A diplomatic resolution may be possible. Failing that, we may be forced to consider more direct methods, boarding the facility or destroying it outright.

infernals.2160.desc: "Ongoing study of the subspace mining station suggests that it stores massive amounts of thermal energy in an exotic form, which our [GetScientistPlural] are calling §Y$entropy_crystals$§!. It leverages thermal feedback loops to magnify energy inputs.\n\nBy replicating this technology, we could learn to wield previously unimaginable power that many would deem unnatural and dangerous.

Crews could also be put on standby to harvest magma directly from the eruption and strain it for precious metals. Alternatively, we could focus on evacuating civilians and supplies from the area to minimize risk.\n\nWe can also continue to monitor the situation before committing to any action, in case the predictions are inaccurate."
infernals.3000.a: "Evacuate!"
infernals.3000.a.tt: "Has §Y500§! $energy$."
infernals.3000.b: "Wait and see."
infernals.3000.c: "Focus on power generation."
infernals.3000.d: "Harvest the magma."

infernals.3005.name: "Just in time"
infernals.3005.desc: "The early evacuation of the colony turned out to be a good choice. The volcano erupted sooner than expected, severely damaging the buildings in the area. Now that the underground volcanic pressure is minimal, the colonists can return and safely rebuild."
infernals.3010.name: "Volcanic Wrath"
infernals.3010.desc: "The volcano exploded early, and the colony was not prepared to deal with the catastrophe. Massive damage occurred to infrastructure, and loss of life was significant."
infernals.3015.name: "Wait and See"
infernals.3015.desc: "After a few months, volcanic activity near the §Y[planet.GetName]§! colony has subsided again. While the long-term safety risk has not disappeared, it appears the colony is safe for the time being."
infernals.3015.a: "The risks paid off."
infernals.3020.name: "Enhanced Power-Grid"
infernals.3020.desc: "Engineering crews were able to establish a safe system for slowly releasing pressurized lava from the underground chambers, passing it through power generators as it went. This has resulted in a short-term boon to the colony's electrical grid."
infernals.3025.name: "Magma Harvesting"
infernals.3025.desc: "The volcanic eruption was interrupted by a combination of ultrasonic disruptors and physical barriers, resulting in a large field of magma contained and hardening on the surface. Mining crews have already begun harvesting this mineral bounty."

# Lava Sports
infernals.3030.name: "Lava Sports"
infernals.3030.desc: "One might think individuals would not want to spend time near open, quick-moving lava flows. At least on §Y[planet.GetName]§!, one would be wrong.\n\nColonists are racing utility hovercraft along active lava flows, dodging floating boulders and boosting themselves over lavafalls. Others are gambling on the outcomes of these races, and gambling dens have drawn the interest of organized crime. A few pilots have even died in a variety of accidents.\n\nThe colony has no laws against this practice, since it was never imagined anyone would do such a thing. We could embrace the colonists' enthusiasm and let them do as they please, but this may lead to ever more dangerous feats, and a potential criminal component, as gambling on these events is already on the rise. Alternatively, we could regulate the sport; while this may cause some grumbling, it should minimize deaths and crime in the long term. Or we could ban it outright, which would be effective, but costly to enforce."
infernals.3030.a: "Let it flow."
infernals.3030.b: "Regulate the sport."
infernals.3030.c: "Ban this foolishness!"
lava_surfboard: "Lava Surfboard"
lava_surfboard_desc_short: "An oblong steel plate with a jury-rigged hover mechanism welded onto the underside"
lava_surfboard_desc_details: "While clearly cobbled together from spare parts, this surfboard used in the lava sports of [Event.Planet.GetName] was crafted with unusual care and cleverness. Its hover system and thermal protections are excellent, and its aesthetic evokes the rugged self-reliance of frontier colonists."

infernals.3035.name: "Let it flow!"
infernals.3035.desc: "Allowing colonists to pursue this trend has generated a boom of excitement around lava sports. Images of pilot veering their hovercraft above lava flows are quickly becoming a symbol of §Y[planet.GetName]§!'s local culture.\n\nUnfortunately, enthusiasm has eclipsed safety. Sporadic reports of racing deaths continue to come in, and it appears criminal money lenders are exploiting the gambling habits of lava sports enthusiasts. While public approval for the sport remains high, we should continue to monitor negative consequences in the future."
infernals.3035.a: "Unsettling."
infernals.3040.name: "Safety Measurements"
infernals.3040.desc: "While colonists initially resented imperial authorities arriving to regulate their beloved pastime, the new safety measures required on racing craft have almost eliminated injuries and fatalities. Racing pilots are speaking up about the benefits of these regulations to their own safety, which is bringing the public on board.\n\nFinancial transparency and taxation have also been imposed on lava sports gambling, with proceeds going to safety outfitting for the racers. Criminal elements have mostly dispersed from the gambling dens, though some colonists complain that taxation by authorities is unjust."
infernals.3040.a: "Better safe than sorry."
infernals.3045.name: "Banned Sport"
infernals.3045.desc: "Law enforcement has been deployed to put a stop to this dangerous practice. Public outcry against enforcement has been powerful and protests have occured throughout the colony, but with the lava flows under constant surveillance and racers unable to compete, deaths have dropped to zero, and the gambling scene has all but evaporated."
infernals.3045.a: "There was no other way."
lava_sports_flow: "Lava Sports: §GAllowed§!"
lava_sports_flow_desc: "Allowing colonists to pursue this trend has generated a boom of excitement around lava sports."
lava_sports_regulated: "Lava Sports: §YRegulated§!"
lava_sports_regulated_desc: "While colonists initially resented imperial authorities arriving to regulate their beloved pastime, the new safety measures required on racing craft have almost completely eliminated injuries and fatalities. Racing pilots are speaking up about the benefits of these regulations to their own safety, which is bringing the public on board."
lava_sports_banned: "Lava Sports: §RBanned§!"
lava_sports_banned_desc: "Law enforcement has been deployed to put a stop to this dangerous practice."

# Kindled Myths
infernals.3055.name: "Kindled Myths"
infernals.3055.desc: "Members of the pre-FTL species on §Y[pre_ftl_planet.GetName]§! have striking similarities to mythological beings from some of our oldest myths. Some of this may be accounted for by broad trends in convergent evolution and psychology, but the more we learn about this species, the more connections we find.\n\nCould these be the same beings from our myths and legends? There is increasing excitement at this prospect, and we could invest in pushing this research further. But sometimes coincidences pile up without deeper meaning, and too much prying could reveal our presence to this society, causing unintended consequences."
infernals.3055.a: "Ignore this coincidence."
infernals.3055.b: "Investigate further."

infernals.3060.name: "Foolish Assumption"
infernals.3060.desc: "Despite some calls to investigate, it would be unwise to chase this hypothesis of mythological aliens any further. After all, this species has its own myths, legends, and ways of seeing itself, which may not fit well with our own preconceptions. Research on the topic has been paused, with funds redirected to other concerns."
infernals.3060.a: "Familiar, yet strange."

infernals.3065.name: "Primitive Turmoils"
infernals.3065.desc: "In our eagerness to link this species to our myths, our agents neglected safe pre-FTL contact protocol. Across the planet, locals have recorded multiple observations of our ships, have stolen equipment, and in one case, kidnapped one of our agents for study. Learning of our existence has caused unrest and polarized responses.\n\nDespite the operational chaos, excitement about the mythological connections persist among our own people. This species is being viewed through an increasingly spiritual lens across our empire."
infernals.3065.a: "We should have been more careful."

infernals.3070.name: "Astounding Discovery"
infernals.3070.desc: "Intensive study of the inhabitants of §Y[pre_ftl_planet.GetName]§! have cooled the mythological hypothesis. While many parallels are found between our oldest stories and these beings, some irreconcilable differences have also been uncovered.\n\nDespite this more complicated picture, enthusiasm for this species remains. It has been suggested that they may be a remnant population of the original beings in our stories, and that differences may be due to the vast spans of time elapsed since. While we are forced to recognize them as their own society today, many in our empire now feel a strong spiritual connection to them."
infernals.3070.a: "An enriching moment for all of us."

# Molten Core Grand Archive specimen
infernals.3200.name: "Molten Core"
infernals.3200.desc: "As the colony on §Y[planet.GetName]§! grew, so too did evidence of an extinct civilization that made use of $sr_living_metal$, though there was no trace of where they acquired this material.\n\nAn answer has recently surfaced, in the form of a strange shimmering sphere encased in a force field which buoyed up from deep core magma flows. Its original purpose and construction are not immediately obvious, but it produces a steady drip of $sr_living_metal$ when exposed to extremely high temperatures. While this handily solves that archaeological puzzle, we must now decide what to do with it."
infernals.3200.a: "Keep the artifact."
infernals.3200.a.accept: "This curious object is unlike anything we have developed. It is not only useful as a source of $sr_living_metal$, but also serves as a scientific and historical curiosity worth studying."
infernals.3200.b: "Toss it back into the lava."
infernals.3200.b.deny: "There is nothing to be admired about a civilization that failed to adapt and went extinct. The artifact is to be disposed of and forgotten."
infernal_molten_core: "Molten Core"
infernal_molten_core_desc_short: "A silvery orb with a rippling, fluid texture, encased in a faintly hissing force field"
infernal_molten_core_desc_details: "The core's force field only slackens when exposed to high temperatures, allowing a drop of $r_living_metal$ to escape. Its original creators are long gone, but this core stands as a testament to their science and ingenuity."
