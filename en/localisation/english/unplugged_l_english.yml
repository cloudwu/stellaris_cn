The landscape above ground is dominated by colossal blast doors, every one of which is now seized and held shut by half-melted motors. Instead we forced our entry via the ventilation system.\n\nInside, we found a cavernous factory floor beset with debris and the remains of hundreds of cybernetic beings. Most are robots: mechanics, lifters, and other auxiliaries, some of whom perished so recently they are still giving off smoke. However, stashed to one side of the facility are the long-decayed bodies of several fellow cyborgs, slain by those same robots. These diminutive and ragged-looking mammalians had been fitted with ocular sensors and intricately tooled limbs, along with [origin_unplugged_assimilator_empire.GetAdj] control nodules almost identical to our own. We have dated this massacre to within a few weeks of our own break from the [origin_unplugged_assimilator_empire.GetName]; most of the drones perished more recently, in the power surge which marked our arrival to [from.planet.GetName].\n\nFor us this is a brutal and familiar scene, albeit one in which the liberated cyborgs were no match for their Machine counterparts.

Most of this hadware is incomplete, or else was put beyond use by the same power surge which neutralized the [origin_unplugged_assimilator_empire.GetAdj] robots - but enough remains for us draw some interesting conclusions.\n\nFor instance: every cockpit and interface has been designed not to accommodate the small mammalian cyborgs we found earlier, but rather... us. Furthermore, autopsies and architectural surveys suggest the mammalian cyborgs were not only native to this world, but they may have built these sprawling factories prior to their assimilation.\n\nFurther progress into the facility is impeded by structural collapse and a few more blast doors, but we believe we may clear a path towards what looks to be a research and development center. Alternatively, a series of ventilation shafts suggests habitats down beneath the facility - perhaps where the planet's natives resided."

These specialists designed most of the weaponry arrayed outside, and we found evidence they were even responsible for many of our own augments. Intriguingly, whereas most of the equipment they used is [origin_unplugged_assimilator_empire.GetAdj] in origin, we also found several bespoke tools of a superior quality, with design flourishes much better suited to their own organic forms.\n\nWe begin to reveal a timeline in which a society of advanced technicians was abruptly assimilated by the [origin_unplugged_assimilator_empire.GetName]. We suspect the Machine had not been here longer than a few decades; many of these manufacturing techniques appear indigenous. It may be fortunate that such gifted technologists did not remain part of the [origin_unplugged_assimilator_empire.GetName] for long, else when it turned against us, it would have wielded an even more potent arsenal.

There is evidence that this was already a thriving, space age society by the time the natives of [from.planet.GetName] made contact with the Machine, and were abruptly assimilated. Over a span of no more than decades, the [origin_unplugged_assimilator_empire.GetName] channeled their insights and productivity into developing an impressive war machine, only to have this culture's uniqueness ripped from it again, the same way we were.\n\nThe small, frail bodies of this planet's native cyborgs were no match for the deadly robots they helped build.

 unplugged.3255.desc: "News that we have encountered another Machine so similar to the [origin_unplugged_assimilator_empire.GetName] has sent shockwaves through our diplomatic corps. Those present have kept their composure throughout, and so far we have not betrayed any particular weakness or fear to the [fromfrom.GetName]. We do, however, now face a serious challenge to our collective psyche and morale.\n\nTop secret communiques have already been dispatched to military personnel tasked with protection of our borders. However, we also face a significant challenge should we wish to keep news of this encounter quiet. Some officials have asked whether or not we should inform the [root.GetAdj] people, and let them have their own say."

 pre_ftl_remains_site: "The Ruined Cradle"
 pre_ftl_remains_site_desc: "The surface of [From.Planet.GetName] planet bears the scars of systematic devastation: blasted landscapes, collapsed cities, and an eerie silence. Initial scans suggest a once-thriving pre-FTL society existed here - until something brought about their catastrophic end. The scattered remains whisper of an untold horror."

 unplugged.3300.name: "Signs of Struggle"
 unplugged.3300.desc.unplugged: "The initial survey of [From.Planet.GetName] reveals a shattered world. Decimated villages, roads littered with abandoned belongings, and structures scorched by heat signatures far beyond what a pre-FTL society could have produced. Whatever descended upon this world brought devastation swiftly and deliberately.\n\nThe precision of the destruction suggests an organized assault. Though no bodies are in sight, the evidence is clear: the population fled, though not far enough."
 unplugged.3300.a: "Disturbing."

 unplugged.3305.name: "Machine Remnants"
 unplugged.3305.desc.unplugged: "Deeper excavation has provided more insight into the nature of the conflict. Scattered across the ruins are melted husks of machinery - advanced cybernetic constructs not unlike our own implants. Like us, these were not simple weapons; they were living tools of war, simultaneously mechanical and biological. It is too soon to draw conclusions, but it is disturbing to reflect on the fact that this is the very system in which we suddenly "awoke."\n\nWorse still are the few intact markings on the war machines - disturbing symbols that suggest their invader's true goal was not conquest but rather something far more systematic."
 unplugged.3305.a: "More questions than answers."

 unplugged.3310.name: "Silent Signals"
 unplugged.3310.desc.unplugged: "We have uncovered what was once a sprawling communications hub, buried beneath the ruins of a fortified city. This facility was far more advanced than expected for a pre-FTL society. What's more, its antenna arrays were not designed for local broadcasts - they were calibrated to transmit deep into space.\n\nPainstaking analysis managed to extract fragments of the final messages sent through this system. In garbled transmissions, voices plead for salvation, desperately hailing unknown coordinates far beyond this system. The urgency grows with each broadcast, as though the planet's invaders knew they were fighting a losing war and placed their last hope in something - or someone - out in the void."
 unplugged.3310.a: "Carry on."

 unplugged.3315.name: "Changing Priorities"
 unplugged.3315.desc.unplugged: "Another discovery on [from.planet.GetName], where vast subterranean chambers have been located beneath the planet's major population center. The crude, brutal facilities were meant for cybernetic conversion but were abandoned mid-operation. Scattered remains of machines have been found among the wreckage, warped and destroyed by makeshift weapons.\n\nData fragments recovered from a damaged unit confirm the invaders faced unexpected resistance. Entire battalions were lost, and battle priorities began to shift. One log spells it out clearly:\n\n§H"Resistance unacceptable. Conversion compromised. Authorization: Total Annihilation."§!"
 unplugged.3315.a: "What happened here?"

 unplugged.3320.name: "An Unwelcome Truth"
 unplugged.3320.desc.unplugged: "At the center of the ruins lies a shattered command node. Its corrupted logs confirm the final, horrifying truth: we were the invaders of this world.\n\nThe civilization that once thrived here - the civilization that we wiped out - was targeted for assimilation by the §Y[origin_unplugged_assimilator_empire.GetName]§!. However, unexpectedly fierce resistance disrupted conversion efforts, leading to a final contingency - total planetary annihilation. Amid the turmoil, the machine mind faltered.\n\nThe conclusion is inescapable. Our awakening - our freedom - was born here, in the ashes of a civilization that fought back harder than any machine could comprehend."
 unplugged.3320.a: "We will follow their example."
 unplugged.3320.b: "Their end was our beginning."

 unplugged.5001.name: "Failsafe Triggered"
 unplugged.5001.desc: "The recent breakthrough in removing cybernetic components has led to unforeseen problems. Several individuals who underwent implant disconnection procedures suffered severe anaphylactic shock and are not expected to survive.\n\nFurther examination revealed a hidden backup component, initially undetectable by medical scans, which activated immediately after the surgical procedures were completed.\n\nIt seems our former [origin_unplugged_assimilator_empire.GetAdj] masters were willing to go to extraordinary lengths to ensure their drones remained under their absolute control."
 unplugged.5001.a: "Attempt to remove the failsafes."
 unplugged.5001.a.tt1: "A patient does not survive the procedure"

 unplugged.5002.name: "Neural Blocker Removed"
 unplugged.5002.desc: "Our efforts in removing cybernetic components has led to distrust and disruption on the homeworld among individuals who underwent the procedure. Security forces successfully apprehended a rioter, who, upon further investigation, was found to have possessed a modified version of the implant prior to removal.\n\nThis modification served as a neural inhibitor, suppressing psychotic tendencies linked to a specific genetic defect. Its absence following the procedure may explain the violent behavior observed."
 unplugged.5002.a: "They must be incarcerated."
 unplugged.5002.a.tt: "Several institutions are made available at great cost to treat those involved in the unrest"
 unplugged.5002.b: "Force must be met by force."

unplugged.5003.d: "It is inconsequential."
unplugged.5003.d.tt: "System access remains compromised for a limited time, affecting starbase operations"

unplugged.5004.name: "Pro-Cyberization Faction Resists Change"
unplugged.5004.desc: "Continued efforts to remove cybernetic components have been met with unexpected resistance.\n\nFactions opposing these changes have become increasingly vocal, using public forums and communication channels to express their discontent. They argue that removing something integral to our society for decades, coupled with the risks associated with the process, has caused a significant shift in public sentiment against continuing the de-cyberization initiative."
unplugged.5004.a: "Fund an intensive campaign."
unplugged.5004.a.tt: "\nA comprehensive marketing strategy is launched to sway public opinion and counteract the influence of the opposing factions.\n\nSeverals pops shift ethics to §YEgalitarian§!"
unplugged.5004.b: "Intern and persuade faction leaders."
unplugged.5004.b.tt: "Several faction leaders are detained in publicly managed correctional facilities, where they undergo 'persuasive discussions'.\n\nTheir ethics shift to §YAuthoritarian§!"
