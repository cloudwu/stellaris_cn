 START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS:0 "To most, the vacuum of space is a hostile environment to be conquered or overcome. To us, it is home. For thousands of years, our species has resided on three space stations, each orbiting a different sun in a trinary star system. Whether they were built by our ancestors or someone else, we do not know.\n\nAlthough our biology would suggest that our species at some point originated on a planet, recorded history makes no mention of it. Some speculate that the shattered planetary remnants found beneath one of our stations is the lost homeworld of our species, but the truth may never be known.\n\nIt has only been a few centuries since spaceflight allowing travel between our three stations was invented - or rediscovered, depending on who you ask. Suspicion and mistrust gradually gave way to trade and mutual cooperation. By the time of our first hyperdrive, the three habitats had united under one flag."
 START_SCREEN_SCION:0 "Early in our history, before we had developed much in the way of technology, our alien benefactors made themselves known to us. They explained, in terms our bewildered ancestors could understand, that our species showed great promise. With much patience, they guided us onto a path that would help our civilization reach its full potential.\n\nOn those few occasions when we strayed from this path, they corrected our course - firmly, as any parent would - but soon our scientists had mastered electricity, then atomic power, and then crude spaceflight. Under the tutelage of our overseers, we have now constructed our first hyperdrives."

While those affected by it experience a feeling of exhilaration and an irresistible urge to dance, their survival instinct means that exhaustion forces them to rest sooner or later. Furthermore, it seems that only some areas are significantly affected by this phenomenon.\n\nLocal entrepreneurs have already begun designating these areas as party zones, advertising [Root.GetName] as the 'Planet of Eternal Festivity', where young and old alike may come to release their shackles and enjoy themselves."

It appears the culprit is a gas released by the local vegetation, which induces feelings of exhilaration and an irresistible urge to dance while suppressing feelings of exhaustion, overriding [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] self-preservation instincts.\n\nFortunately, our scientists have developed a synthetic gas that - once released into the air - will neutralize the effects of the 'dancing gas'. Furthermore, it seems that the 'dancing gas' has certain valuable properties we can make use of, if we can extract it from the plants before it is released into the air."

 colony_fed.100.desc:1 "A geological anomaly has come to our attention on [Root.GetName]. We began surveying after a bowl-shaped depression suddenly appeared alongside a mining facility there. Features like this are almost never found outside of a glacial region, but stranger still: the walls of this 'cirque' scatter visible light in a flower-petal pattern, and have been found to resonate when exposed to certain electro-magnetic bands. Investigations are ongoing."

 colony_fed.105.name:0 "Project Blue Lotus"
 colony_fed.105.desc:1 "Our scientists report that the newly-uncovered, crystalline blue deposits on [Root.GetName] respond dramatically to delayed-erasure photon energy. The minerals filter its wavelengths and reflect a beam which is capable of transforming ordinary silicates into a new, super-conductive alloy — though only ever during daylight.\n\nGiven that this process essentially involves bouncing high levels of radiation around an enclosed space, some scientists have already come out in protest. A different group of excited researchers offers a counter-argument, stressing that this phenomenon could revolutionize the way we refine precious metals. Either way: developing this technique further will be costly."
 colony_fed.105.gestalt.desc:0 "A rogue drone has been found running its own project within the cirque on [Root.GetName]. Driven by its initial directive - to refine our methods of mineral extraction - it has since stumbled onto a means of transforming everyday silicates into a new type of alloy.\n\nThe process seems to involve bouncing high-energy beams off mineral deposits in the feature's wall. The drone's eagerness in its task has caused it to flood the area with excessive levels of radiation. It has therefore been isolated pending either re-integration, or destruction of its individuality and acquired knowledge."
 colony_fed.105.a:0 "Bring it back into the fold."
 colony_fed.105.b:0 "Let's see where this research goes."
 colony_fed.105.c:0 "Cease experiments at once."

 colony_fed.106.name:0 "Overly-Keen Proponents"
 colony_fed.106.desc:0 "Regrettable scenes on [Root.GetName], as a group of obsessive scientists sought to intervene in the project's closure. Dazzled by their own research, they attempted to wrest control of the transmutation experiments 'for the benefit of new science.' The resulting scuffle caused equipment to be damaged, and a runaway cascade took hold.\n\nWhat remains of the cirque is something akin to a geode: a rocky shell around what used to be the equipment and protestors, now re-rendered in crystalline form."

 colony_fed.107.name:0 "Breakaway Alchemist"
 colony_fed.107.desc:0 "The wayward drone and its findings have been successfully purged. The results of its fluke experiments now litter the landscape; a small amount of useful material has been reclaimed."

 colony_fed.110.desc:0 "The laboratory on [From.GetName] is yielding verifiable results. Although their process can still only transmute small amounts of rock into alloys, researchers have high hopes for a larger-scale operation. They have requested access to further resources."
 colony_fed.110.gestalt.desc:0 "The rogue experiments on [Root.GetName] are yielding results. Although the process can still only transmute small amounts of matter into this new metal, the experiment is now verifiable. This could warrant more dedicated research efforts."

 colony_fed.111.name:0 "Lotus Collapse"
 colony_fed.111.desc:0 "The transmutation experiments at [From.GetName] have failed - though their failure may actually have prevented future catastrophe. When new, more refined equipment was first brought online, it ran well within design tolerances. However, when shut-down instructions were issued, the process accelerated beyond the reach of its failsafes. Conversion took hold in the facility's housing, transmuting it and its surroundings into the same, super-conductive alloy.\n\nThe resulting ground explosion has taken a number of lives along with significant chunks of the surrounding landscape. We're left with little other than a seam of good material, and a cautionary tale in metaphysics."

 colony_fed.120.desc:0 "A catastrophic failure has occurred at the experimental facility on [Root.GetName]. Operatives say we may never know what specifically caused the failure in containment, but the result was runaway transmutation of the equipment, its housing, and a vast chunk of the surrounding landscape - all into the same, superconductive alloy. A rich seam of this material is all that remains."

 federations3.1010.name:0 "Depot Deposits"
 federations3.1010.desc:0 "It wasn't long before our excavations revealed tunnels and equipment of sturdier construction and more intricate design. Heavy-gauge rails and sleepers lie preserved and intact, surrounded by myriad relics and centuries-old garbage.\n\nAmongst the debris lie various precisely-anodized pieces of engine and signalling equipment, such as one might find in a §Ymaintenance depot§!. All are inscribed in singular detail with complex, geometric patterns - suggesting high levels of artistry and perhaps even pride."
 federations3.1015.name:0 "The Well-Armed Visitor"
 federations3.1015.desc:0 "Our chance excavation of a narrow side-tunnel has revealed a long-dead reptilian occupant, whose demise by ceiling collapse dates back some §Y800 years§!. Their presence in this tunnel was something of a puzzle, solved only when we completed a study of the many weapons found on their person.\n\nThe technology underlying these bladed implements - many of which were mounted on the inside of a decorative targe - is primitive compared to our own, yet markedly different to that used on the railroad. This targe-bearing visitor was as alien to this world as we are, and they seem to have been conducting similar archaeological research - that is, before the tunnel claimed their life."
 federations3.1015.a:0 "Translate their findings."
 federations3.1020.name:0 "The Targe-Bearer"
 federations3.1020.desc:0 "The Targe-bearer's notes have led us to an §Yelectrical substation§! which once served this maintenance yard. It looks like their expedition broke an atmospheric seal on the facility; there are comparatively few signs of decay here. Dust-covered cable ducts form colonnades around dozens of monitors. It is down one such aisle of monitors that we found trace remains from §Ysentients of a different species§!.\n\nThe Targe-bearer's expedition described this as a group of molluscoid technicians - their still-preserved bodies huddled together for mutual protection or warmth. The records also note two attempts to restart the millennia-old substation, using tools which are inferior to ours. There's a chance we could complete this effort - and in so doing, make further excavation much easier."
 federations3.1021.name:0 "Tragic Coil"
 federations3.1021.desc:0 "Mere minutes after we jump-started the substation on [From.Planet.GetName] using a portable phase generator, the facility erupted with piercing alarms. Seconds later, part of the ceiling and a section of wall adjoining the railroad collapsed, right where our excavation team was working.\n\nThe fault has been traced to a §Rcorroded resistor coil§!, which we'd thought disconnected. This oversight caused several injuries and has sealed the fates of a dozen members of our dig team; they now follow in the Targe-bearer's tragic footsteps."
 federations3.1022.name:0 "Onto a Different Track"
 federations3.1022.desc:0 "This relic of a substation has surprised us with its complexity. We jump-started it using a portable phase generator, but the ensuing burst of activity caused parts of the millennia-old structure around us to collapse.\n\nFortunately our team had sufficient warning to find shelter. They emerged to find some areas now firmly closed off, but some new areas have opened in their stead."
 federations3.1026.name:0 "Back in Service"
 federations3.1026.desc:0 "Our accidental remodelling of this dig site exposed a long-distance rail tunnel down which - according to the control panels we deciphered - a train lay, tucked away in sidings. Those same systems had applied various priority markers to the train, including a word we've identified as '§Yrepository§!.'\n\nA team was dispatched to get the train moving again, for rarely does a key artifact come to us in a form as large as this. The antique locomotive is an elegant enough piece of engineering in itself, but every one of the elaborately-decorated cars behind it has proven to be a museum in its own right.\n\nThe train may best be described as a roaming time capsule, ever ready to be moved out of harm's way. For 3,000 years it has preserved the historical, cultural and scientific records of an entire culture, whom we now learn called themselves the §YPeeyeps§!."
 federations3.1026.a:0 "Bring these records back to our homeworld for further study."
 federations3.1027.name:0 "Naught But Empty Sheds"
 federations3.1027.desc:0 "Our accidental remodelling of this dig site has exposed a goods yard, hewn from under a vast and vaulted cave roof. Of its many vast and vacant warehouses, only one had its security seals tripped; upon re-opening it we found the remains of more of the Targe-bearer's people. They had come seeking supplies, only to fall foul of a millennia-old alarm system.\n\nAccording to the logs they left behind, this itinerant '§YFenrunir Expeditionary Group§!' was investigating [From.Planet.GetName] as part of a habitable worlds survey. They hadn't anticipated finding ruins here. Untrained and uninterested in archaeology, they ransacked the site rather than investigating it.\n\nThose who met with starvation inside the warehouse note - in particularly colorful language - that their comrades removed a great deal of material to their freighters, leaving little behind. Our own surveys confirm that although there is an abundance of antique machinery, little else remains to tell us who the enigmatic railroad-builders were."
 federations3.1030.name:0 "Rails and Refuge"
 federations3.1030.desc:0 "The records left by the railroad-builders of [From.From.Planet.GetName] tell how this fervent band of molluscoids fled their technophobic homeland, seeking to better themselves through mechanical endeavor. They retreated to a secret and distant network of §Yunderground caves§!, later linking and expanding their habitats by means of railroad tunnels.\n\nFearful that their very culture may one day be hunted and eradicated, the Peeyeps built deep - for security and preservation. Their society grew slowly over the next 200 years, during which time their homeland's government turned more insular and paranoid. A single, radical swing provoked them into militarization on an unprecedented scale; at this point the chronicle ends abruptly.\n\nEven with the Targe-bearer's own subsequent, patchy findings, we can only speculate upon the tragic fates of both peoples. Further archaeological evidence has either been lost or gone unrecorded; all that remains of the Peeyeps now are their tunnels, their records and their trains."
