As our empire grows it can be organized into Sectors, which are helpful for administering larger empires.\n\n§SSectors§! can be automated here, and if they are automated they can be given a specialization and resources to enable planets within them to build and upgrade §SBuildings§! and §SDistricts§! on their planets."
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_FLEET_TITLE:0 "Military Fleets"
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_FLEET_DESC:1 "§SMilitary Fleets§! are used to protect our emerging empire from threats... or to expand our glorious rule through force of arms, if we so wish.\n\nOur current §SNavy Size§! is limited, but it can be increased by researching new technologies, owning additional §SPops§! and building §SStarbase Anchorages§!. No §SAdmiral§! has been assigned to our starting fleet, so if we have the §SEnergy Credits§! to spare we may wish to recruit one."
 TUTORIAL_SCIENCE_SHIP_TITLE:0 "Science Ships"
 TUTORIAL_SCIENCE_SHIP_DESC:3 "This is our §SScience Ship§!, which is used to §SSurvey§! astronomical objects such as planets in a star system. A planet needs to be surveyed in order to make its §SResources§! visible.\n\nOur home system has already been surveyed, so we should focus our efforts elsewhere. With the Science Ship selected, open the §SGalaxy Map§!, right click on a star neighboring our home system and select §SSurvey System§!. The ship will now travel to this system and survey all of its planetary bodies."
 TUTORIAL_CONSTRUCTION_SHIP_TITLE:0 "Construction Ships"

 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_PLANET_TITLE:0 "Planet Summary"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_PLANET_DESC:3 "This is our homeworld and the §SCapital§! of our empire. The §SPlanet Summary§! screen, which we are currently looking at, provides an overview of the planet's important statistics.\n\nWe can see the total number of §SDistricts§! this planet can support, how many §SPops§! are living on it, and how much §SFood§! and other §SResources§! it produces and consumes. We can also see if the planet is suffering from low §SStability§!, and if there is an assigned §SGovernor§!, they are found here. We may also set a designation, if desired, and have the option to automate the planet."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_TILES_TITLE:1 "Population View"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_TILES_DESC:2 "Here we see a breakdown of this planet's population, divided into layers, or §SStrata§!.\n\nThey can be expanded to view the §SJob§! types within each §SStratum§!. §SJobs§! use and produce different resources, and the Pop working a Job needs a certain amount of §SHousing§! and §SAmenities§!. A lack of either will reduce §SHappiness§!, which can lower the planet's §SStability§!."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_COMBAT_TITLE:0 "Army View"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_COMBAT_DESC:4 "This is where we manage all ground forces on this planet. This screen also tracks how much §SDevastation§!, or damage, the planet itself has suffered.\n\nNew §SArmies§! are also raised here, by clicking the §SRecruit§! button in the center. §SDefense Armies§! are produced automatically by §SPops§! working Enforcer or Soldier §SJobs§!.

 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_STATION_TITLE:0 "Military Stations"
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_STATION_DESC:2 "§SMilitary Stations§! are static defenses that can be used to protect important planets or strategic avenues of approach, but can only be built within our borders or territories we have special access to.\n\nTake care not to build too many - like ships, their upkeep costs will be a drain on our economy."
 TUTORIAL_RESEARCH_STATION_TITLE:0 "Research Stations"
 TUTORIAL_RESEARCH_STATION_DESC:1 "A §SResearch Station§! built in orbit of a planetary body will gather its §SPhysics§!, §SEngineering§! and §SSociety§! research data.\n\nThey can only be built within our borders, and they are not needed if the planet has already been colonized."
 TUTORIAL_MINING_STATION_TITLE:0 "Mining Stations"
 TUTORIAL_MINING_STATION_DESC:2 "§SMining Stations§! are used to extract the §SMinerals§! and §SStrategic Resources§! of the objects they orbit.\n\n§SMining Stations§! are not needed to access the resources of colonized planets, and can only be built within our borders."

In order to make a deal or agreement you must have a sufficent Relations level.\n\nYour §SEnvoys§! can be assigned to an Empire to bypass Relations requirements or to Improve or Harm Relations."
 TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_VIEW_TRADE_TITLE:0 "Trade"
 TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_VIEW_TRADE_DESC:0 "This is the §STrade screen§!. We can trade any type of §SResource§! with an Empire, as well §SInformation§! and §SFavors§!.\n\nFavors can be spent to increase an Empire's willingness to accept an agreement. You can also call in Favors during a Vote on the Senate Floor in the Galactic Community to Boost your Diplomatic Weight."

 TUTORIAL_EMPIREVIEW_FACTIONS_TITLE:0 "Factions"
 TUTORIAL_EMPIREVIEW_FACTIONS_DESC:3 "The §SFactions§! screen gives an overview of the populace's political leanings. Be aware that shifts in the sociopolitical climate may give rise to §SFactions§!. Details on §SFaction§! sizes, attractiveness to our Pops, and how content they are may also be found here.\n\n§SFactions§! have §SIssues§! that are important to their overall §SApproval§!, and our policies and actions as a nation may displease or please these groupings, providing an increasing boost to £influence£ §SInfluence§! generation. The strength of §SFactions§! and the nature of their §SIssues§! can change along with our circumstances, but keep in mind that the §SHappiness§! of a §SPop§! can be affected by the §SApproval§! of the §SFaction§! it belongs to.\n\nWe can also §SManage Factions§! to manipulate the relationship between a §SFaction§! and the state, even going so far as embracing the ethos of a strong §SFaction§!."
 TUTORIAL_CREATESECTOR_TITLE:0 "Sector Management"
 TUTORIAL_CREATESECTOR_DESC:2 "To establish a §SSector§!, first select a planet in §SFrontier space§! and press the Create Sector button.

 TUTORIAL_GALACTIC_COMMUNITY_RESOLUTIONS_TITLE:0 "Resolutions"
 TUTORIAL_GALACTIC_COMMUNITY_RESOLUTIONS_DESC:0 "The §HResolutions§! screen is a list of the currently enacted resolutions.

Anomalies must be researched before the planet they were found on can be colonized or otherwise exploited."
 advisor.15.name:0 "Potential Colony"
 advisor.15.desc:1 "One of our §SScience Ships§! has just surveyed a world that would make an excellent candidate for our first colony. It is of the same §Splanet class§! as our homeworld, so our colonists should be quite comfortable there.\n\nBefore we can colonize this world, however, our borders must be extended to cover the system it is in. This is accomplished by using a §SConstruction Ship§! to build a §SStarbase§! there."

 tutorial.3.desc:2 "Researching new technologies will be critical to our success. I tell you this not merely as a product of unfettered technological progress, but as your trusted advisor and, I suspect, your only true friend.\n\nOne important technology that we should research as soon as possible is §SNew Worlds Protocol§!. It will give us access to §SColony Ships§! which will allow us to establish footholds on other planets."
 tutorial.6.name:0 "Technologies Researched"
 tutorial.6.desc:1 "Excellent work! The technology we just finished researching will certainly benefit us. Don't forget to give our scientists new research assignments."
 tutorial.7.name:0 "Tutorial: Construction Ship"
 tutorial.7.desc:1 "The resources generated by our homeworld will only take us so far. Our industry needs to expand off-world, and that requires a §SConstruction Ship§!.\n\nWe should build one as soon as we have amassed enough §SAlloys§! to do so."
 tutorial.8.name:0 "Construction Ship Built"
 tutorial.8.desc:0 "Good job! Our §SConstruction Ship§! is now up and running, and its hardy crew includes some of the finest engineers available to our nation."
 tutorial.9.name:0 "Tutorial: Mining Station"
 tutorial.9.desc:1 "The resources generated by our homeworld will only take us so far. Luckily our §SScience Ship§! has just found a resource deposit on another world! The time has come to use our §SConstruction Ship§! to build a §SMining Station§!.\n\nMining Stations can be built within our borders and automatically collect §SMinerals§! and any §SStrategic Resources§! found on the bodies they orbit. Keep in mind that they have an £energy£ §SEnergy Credit§! upkeep cost."
 tutorial.10.name:0 "Mining Station Built"

 tutorial.13.name:1 "Tutorial: Planetary Districts and Buildings"
 tutorial.13.desc:4 "As an astute observer may already have noticed, habitable planets are divided into a number of §SDistricts§! and have multiple §SBuilding Slots§!. Districts provide §SJobs§! which produce basic resources, while §SPlanetary Buildings§! provide jobs which produce services or refined resources.\n\nOur homeworld already has several districts and a few buildings, including our capital, but the time has come to add more. §SPops§! who do not have a job are considered to be §SUnemployed§!.\n\nMore building slots will be unlocked as the number of Pops increases."
 tutorial.14.name:0 "Building Constructed"

 tutorial.15.name:1 "Tutorial: Blocked Features"
 tutorial.15.desc:1 "§SPlanetary Features§! on habitable planets are sometimes blocked, preventing their exploitation. Clearing a £blocker£ §SBlocked Feature§! takes time and costs £minerals£ §SMinerals§! or £energy£ §SEnergy Credits§!, but the free space often makes it worthwhile.\n\nMany blocked features require specific technologies before they can be removed, but the ones on our homeworld can be dealt with as soon as we have the credits to spare."
 tutorial.16.name:0 "Blocker Cleared"

 tutorial.22.name:0 "Tutorial: Recruit Scientist"
 tutorial.22.desc:1 "We have a brand new §SScience Ship§!, but no §SScientist§! has been assigned to command it. My programming insists that I should point out the benefits of adding an organic §SScientist§! component to the mix.\n\nIf we cannot afford to recruit a new §SScientist§! we can always reassign one from another department, even though it is hardly ideal."
 tutorial.23.name:0 "Scientist Recruited"

 tutorial.27.name:0 "Colony Established"
 tutorial.27.desc:0 "Our first extrasolar colony! This means that if our homeworld were to spontaneously combust, your species would no longer be rendered extinct. That is a comforting thought, wouldn't you say?"
 tutorial.28.name:0 "Tutorial: Recruit Governor"
 tutorial.28.desc:0 "To help our new colony along, we should consider the recruitment of a §SPlanetary Governor§! to oversee operations there.\n\nGovernors can have a number of different effects on the planets they govern, most of them positive. These effects depend on the traits and skill level of the Governor."
 tutorial.29.name:0 "Governor Recruited"
 tutorial.29.desc:0 "Our colony is now administered by a new §SGovernor§!. This should increase its efficiency!"
 tutorial.30.name:0 "Tutorial: More Colonies"
 tutorial.30.desc:0 "As soon as we have the resources, it would be a good idea to build more §SColony Ships§! and expand the borders of our empire further. We should work towards establishing at least three more colonies in addition to our homeworld and the one we just settled."
 tutorial.32.name:0 "Colonies Established"
 tutorial.32.desc:0 "Brilliant work! Very inspiring. Our mighty civilization now extends to five worlds! We should keep expanding as opportunity allows."
 tutorial.33.name:0 "Tutorial: Resource Production"
 tutorial.33.desc:3 "A healthy supply of §SMinerals§!, §SAlloys§! and §SEnergy Credits§! is critical to the well-being of any interstellar power. We should take steps to increase our production of these resources.\n\nStations and Buildings cost Alloys or Minerals to build and Energy Credits to maintain. The same is true for Ships, except that they have an Alloy upkeep cost as well. These resources are produced by §SMining Stations§! or §SPlanetary Buildings§!. \n\nLater you may discover new and interesting resources to spend on esoteric new production."

 tutorial.43.desc:0 "Good! We now have a small but capable space fleet that should serve us well in the event of any unexpected hostile encounters."
 tutorial.44.name:0 "Tutorial: Establish Sector"
 tutorial.44.desc:1 "Our burgeoning empire has now reached a size where it is becoming difficult to administer directly from our homeworld. We should establish a new §SSector§!.\n\nSectors are areas within our empire that can be set to independently manage the day-to-day affairs of the planets under their jurisdiction."
 tutorial.45.name:0 "Sector Established"
 tutorial.45.desc:2 "As our empire grows, new colonies can be organized into §SSectors§!. Sectors can be automated from the §SPlanets and Sectors§! screen to automatically build and upgrade Districts and Buildings using assigned pools of resources."

 tutorial.49.name:0 "Ship Designed"
 tutorial.49.desc:1 "Good job. The ship design has been added to our database, and can now be produced by a §SStarbase§! that has been equipped with a §SShipyard§!."
 tutorial.50.name:0 "Tutorial: Observation Posts"
 tutorial.50.desc:1 "We have discovered a §SPrimitive Civilization§!! Some would dismiss these aliens as little more than filthy savages, but there are those who see merit in studying their culture, such as it is.\n\nThis can be done by building an §SObservation Post§! above their homeworld, assuming it is within our borders. These stations have a number of different §SMissions§! that can be assigned, depending on how we want to deal with the natives."
 tutorial.51.name:0 "Observation Post Built"

 tutorial.53.desc:1 "The anomaly we detected on [From.GetName] unveils something astonishing. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] is surrounded by a trail undoubtedly produced by FTL engines. We are unable to trace it to its origin, due to it being generated long ago.\n\n$tutorial.52.filler.desc$"
 tutorial.53.xenophobe.desc:1 "We have detected a weak FTL trail near [From.GetName]. It is very old, making it impossible to track. This must mean that other interstellar travelers have been here before, watching us, surely gathering intel.\n\n$tutorial.52.filler.desc$"
 tutorial.53.xenophile.desc:1 "The anomaly on the [From.GetPlanetMoon] [From.GetName] shows traces of other interstellar travelers! A weak FTL trail shows that someone was here long ago, maybe watching our planet for potential allies. It is too diminished to trace any further.\n\n$tutorial.52.filler.desc$"

 tutorial.70.name:0 "Tutorial: Warp Travel"
 tutorial.70.desc:0 "To overcome the vast distances that separate star systems, our scientists have developed the §SWarp Drive§!. Ships equipped with this device can travel between systems at velocities exceeding that of lightspeed.\n\nAlthough ships can warp to any system within range, warp drives can only be activated outside the gravity well of a star. Ships coming out of warp also require time to power up their systems again - the length of this process depends on how far the ship has traveled."
 tutorial.71.name:0 "Tutorial: Hyperspace Travel"
 tutorial.71.desc:1 "To overcome the vast distances that separate star systems, our scientists have developed the §SHyper Drive§!. This device permits travel at speeds far exceeding that of light between systems connected by hyperlanes.\n\nTravel along a hyperlane is extremely fast, but interstellar movement is restricted along the paths of the galactic hyperlane network. Safely entering hyperspace is only possible at the edge of a system, beyond the destabilizing effects of the star's gravity well."
 tutorial.72.name:0 "Tutorial: Wormhole Travel"
 tutorial.72.desc:0 "To overcome the vast distances that separate star systems, our scientists have developed §SWormhole§! technology. Stations equipped with wormhole generators can tunnel through subspace, creating temporary gateways to other systems that ships can travel through.\n\nWormhole travel is near-instantaneous, but it requires the presence of a Wormhole Station within range. Ships also need to be equipped with special wormhole stabilizers to withstand the stress of passing through subspace."

 tutorial.75.name:1 "Tutorial: Starbases"
 tutorial.75.desc:2 "Now that we have begun exploring our neighboring stars, it might be time to extend our reach. A §SStarbase§! can be built around stars in surveyed systems to expand our borders, allowing us to claim new regions of space.\n\nWith future technologies, Starbases can be upgraded to produce ships or other resources. For now, their main benefit lies in extending our borders. When we have claimed a system with a Starbase, we can build §SResearch§! and §SMining Stations§! to exploit its resources, or colonize any habitable worlds."
 tutorial.76.name:1 "Starbase Established"
