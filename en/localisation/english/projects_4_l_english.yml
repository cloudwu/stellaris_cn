 DPORTAL_PROJECT_PSI_PRAYER_DESC:0 "Such a portal can surely be countered with Psionic energy!"
 DPORTAL_PROJECT_ROCKS:0 "Close the portal!"
 DPORTAL_PROJECT_ROCKS_DESC:0 "Perhaps dumping enough rock into the portal will block it up?"
 SNEK_SCIENCE_PROJECT:0 "Use Science"
 SNEK_SCIENCE_PROJECT_DESC:1 "Science! We're using science! After a series of careful observations and productive meetings, we intend to find patterns in the ophidians' behaviors and methodically adopt plans to counter them. If we can find evidence of tool use and adaptive strategy, we may even be able to reason with them! We just need to make sure not to corrupt the data by interfering with their activities, even when they're biting colonists and siphoning power."
 SNEK_WAR_PROJECT:0 "Use Soldiers"
 SNEK_WAR_PROJECT_DESC:1 "War! We're going to war! We don't know why they came here. We don't fully know what they do here. But we do know this: they hate us, so they must learn to fear us.

No matter what the cost, we've got to stand and deliver against anything that slithers."
