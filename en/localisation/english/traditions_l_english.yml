 ap_engineered_evolution_desc:0 "To leave our genetic destiny in the hands of nature is an inefficient and excruciatingly slow process. Why not jump-start the future of our species?"
 ap_evolutionary_mastery_desc:0 "Evolution is a single-minded beast that follows a single path to its inevitable conclusion. We cannot afford to limit ourselves thus - let us explore all paths simultaneously."

 ap_the_flesh_is_weak_desc:0 "The limits and constraints imposed on us by our feeble organic bodies are simply unacceptable. To reach our full potential, we must turn to cybernetic implants."
 ap_synthetic_evolution_desc:0 "It is time to abandon the flawed organic vessels that imprison our minds. By transferring our neural patterns into synthetic bodies, we will achieve a higher state of being."

 ap_mind_over_matter_desc:0 "Only a fraction of the potential contained within our minds has been unlocked. The latent psionic abilities of our species are only now beginning to manifest in certain individuals."
 ap_transcendence_desc:0 "We stand on the threshold of awakening the true psionic might of our species. Our minds are ready, and we have heard whispers of a psychic realm beyond our own..."
 
 ap_world_shaper_desc:0 "To carefully shape and alter the ecosystem of an entire planet into something else is not so very different from an artist sculpting a statue out of clay."
 ap_master_builders_desc:0 "Building a Megastructure requires an unprecedented amount of resources and planning. We are breaking new ground in the field of macro-engineering."
 ap_imperial_prerogative_desc:0 "As our civilization continues to grow, so its beating heart must also expand. More systems will be placed under our direct control."
 ap_one_vision_desc:0 "True unity is achieved only when the ultimate goals of a nation and its people are one and the same. After all, a house divided against itself cannot stand."
 ap_consecrated_worlds_desc:0 "The galaxy is home to many holy places, some more obvious than others. As mortals, we still struggle to divine the true nature of the universe."
 ap_galactic_force_projection_desc:0 "The fleet is the instrument by which the will of our empire is made manifest - we live or die depending on its strength."
 ap_defender_of_the_galaxy_desc:0 "As star nations vie with one another in petty disputes, sinister forces of unimaginable power are arraying themselves against all sentient life. Who will protect us?"
 ap_galactic_contender_desc:0 "The Fallen Empires cling to the ruins of their decrepit civilizations, ever fearful of the younger and more dynamic races that surround them. Their time has long since passed."
 ap_technological_ascendancy_desc:0 "Technologies that would have been indistinguishable from magic mere generations ago are now within our reach. A new age of technology has begun."
 ap_mastery_of_nature_desc:0 "Although we mastered the nature of our homeworld long ago, the alien biomes we have since encountered present new challenges. They too shall be overcome."
 ap_voidborn_desc:0 "Space, once seen as a cold and insurmountable barrier, has become a second home to us. More and more of our young reach adulthood without ever setting foot on a planet."
 ap_the_circle_of_life_desc:0 "A massive ring-shaped megastructure with artificial habitats built around the orbital circumference of a star. In theory, it could be done..."
 ap_galactic_wonders_desc:0 "Megastructures are rightfully regarded as the wonders of our time. The scope of such a project would have been unimaginable mere generations ago."
 ap_interstellar_dominion_desc:0 "Our place amongst the stars is assured and irrefutable, and the borders of our nation equally so."
