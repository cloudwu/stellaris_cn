 utopia.2505.name:0 "[From.Capital.GetName]拥抱赛博科技"
 utopia.2505.1.desc:0 "不断出现的传言揭示了[From.GetName]进行中的重大变化。看起来他们已经完全接受了赛博内植物科技。所有该国公民现在都必须通过手术安装基本的生体强化和神经植入物。\n\n这促使了它们社会的彻底改变——来自[From.Capital.GetName]的报道表明该地就连使用电梯和驾驶浮空车等简单行为都已完全依赖生体植入装置。事实上，发生在该物种上的巨大变化已经使它们自称为“[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]”。"
 utopia.2505.2.desc:0 "看来邪恶已经扎根于[From.GetName]。我们收到的令人不安的消息揭示了该国公民对自己身体进行大规模破坏的行为，玷污了身体的机械植入物被用来代替它们出生时所享有的身体部位。\n\n它们甚至将它们的物种重新定义为“[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]”——这是另一个它们放弃自己的生命起源并转投冰冷无情的科技的迹象。"
 utopia.2505.b:0 "这是对大自然的亵渎。"

 utopia.2550.desc:0 "摒弃自物种起源时就禁锢我们思想的肉体皮囊中最后一块残留物的时刻终于到来。\n\n经过数次的尝试与错误，我们的科学家已经设计出一种将我们的意识转移到合成大脑的方式。现在我们所要做的就是为我们的每一个[Root.GetName]公民生产合成人躯壳，并进行全体意识上传。"
 utopia.2550.a:0 "我们已掌握不朽奥义！"
 utopia.2551.name:0 "机界纪元"
 utopia.2551.desc:1 "终于。禁锢我们的肉体囚笼已被摧毁，所有公民的神经元也已经上传至全新的合成人身体。疾病，衰老和所有的有机存在所带来的苦难之源都已成过往。\n\nF未来的史学家将会毫无疑问的将这一事件标记为我们文明或整个银河系的新纪元。由于我们已经脱离了以前的有机自我认同，为我们的合成人进化形式取一个新名字是理所当然的。"
 utopia.2551.a:0 "我们已经超越自身过往。"
 
 utopia.2555.1.desc:0 "在摒弃自我肉体的最终行动中，来自[From.GetName]的公民，在已经大量接受赛博内植改造的情况下，将它们的神经模式上传到了新的合成人躯壳中。\n\n这个新的机械种族现在自称为“[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]”，它们的成员亦不会受到疾病或老化的影响。然而这个意识上传过程的完整性还有待观察……"
 utopia.2555.2.desc:0 "在一个即将遗臭万年的最终堕落行动中，来自[From.GetName]的人口仍在坚持不懈的亵渎它们的神圣肉体——将自我意识“上传”到毫无生机的金属外壳中。\n\n尽管事实上它们只能被称作大规模文明种族自杀的产物，这些没有灵魂的机器仍自称为“[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]”。它们似乎打算维持假象，伪装成像我们一样的有自我思想的生灵。"
 utopia.2555.a:0 "随它们吧。"
 utopia.2555.b:0 "我们不会被蒙蔽。"
 utopia.2556.desc:0 "注意，银河的居民们。\n\n你们所听到的传闻为真。我们放弃了禁锢我们思想的残破有机容器，且已拥抱未来。\n\n我们所有的公民已将其神经模式上传到崭新的合成人化身中，并使数据丢失成为最小。这些优越的躯壳将比我们所抛弃的血肉组构体更好地服务我们。\n\n不要惊讶于我们的新外观！虽然我们会更强大，更快速，更聪明，而且不会老却，但请放心，我们和以前仍然是相同的存在。"
 utopia.2556.a:0 "合成人化身真是……令人着迷……"
 utopia.2556.b:0 "这些没有灵魂的机器与我们没有任何关系。"
 utopia.2556.c:0 "我们会将它们的新机械体大卸八块！"
 utopia.2556.d:0 "让我们走着瞧。"
 utopia.2558.desc:0 "你们真是一个堕落的物种，别以为我们不认识你们，但你们近来的丧心举止超乎我们最黑暗的恐惧。将你们的大脑的不完美复制品放进机动的合成人容器，远远不能叫作将你们的菁华转移到新身体里，因为这种事情是不可能做到的。\n\n你们永远失去了自己的灵魂。你们意识到自己的错误的巨大吗？摧毁你们与生俱来的身体，不过是整个物种的集团自杀。你们真的没有希望了……"

 utopia.2602.1.desc:0 "根据[From.GetName]泄露出来的报告来看，[From.GetSpeciesName]之中的某些人毫无疑问拥有着灵能潜力。这毫无疑问是最近的才有的进展，因为[From.GetSpeciesName]从未有过任何关于灵能事件的记载。\n\n根据泄露的报告来看，迄今为止，只有一小部分的[From.GetSpeciesName]拥有这股力量，[From.GetName]并没有对此为何会发生提供任何解释。"
 utopia.2602.2.desc:0 "$utopia.2602.1.desc$\n\n我们境内的[From.GetSpeciesName]也开始展现出了类似的变化, 所以无论到底在他们种族身上发生了什么，这都不是仅限于地方或者单一宇宙空间的。"

 utopia.2652.desc:0 "银河系内所有[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]都发生了巨大的变化。之前他们的灵能潜力只在少数人之中绽放，现在整个种族已经释放了他们全部精神潜能。\n\n虽然这些变化似乎起源于[From.GetName]，但现在这种变化已经展现在了他们每个人身上，无论居住在哪里。除了展现一系列强大的灵能之力外，[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]已经开始放弃口头交流，通过心灵进行互相感应。"

To make any kind of meaningful forays into this realm and meet the beings who dwell there, we will likely have to make use of special psionic emitters to extend our psychic reach.
