 TUTORIAL_GOVERNMENTVIEW_GOVERNMENT_TITLE:0 "Government"
 TUTORIAL_GOVERNMENTVIEW_GOVERNMENT_DESC:0 "The §SGovernment§! screen presents us with information regarding our empire and its government. Here we can see our §SRuler§! and any related effects.\n\nSeparate tabs give a detailed overview of our §SBudget§!, any §SPolicies§! that can be enacted, and information on the §SDemographics§! of our nation."
 TUTORIAL_TECH_VIEW_TITLE:0 "Technology"
 TUTORIAL_TECH_VIEW_DESC:0 "The §STechnology§! screen is where we will be directing our research efforts. Technologies are categorized into three different fields, with each field typically having three available research options.\n\nWe can research technologies without assigning a §SScientist§! to the relevant field, but this will take significantly longer and is generally not recommended!"
 TUTORIAL_CONTACTSVIEW_EMPIRES_TITLE:0 "Contacts"
 TUTORIAL_CONTACTSVIEW_EMPIRES_DESC:0 "In the §SContacts§! screen we see a detailed list of all the various §SEmpires§! we have encountered. Their §SOpinions§! of us are visible at a glance, and we can quickly and easily engage in §SDiplomacy§!.\n\nThe §SSpecies§! tab shows a list of all alien species we have encountered, as well as their associated §STraits§!."
 TUTORIAL_SITUATION_LOG_TITLE:0 "Situation Log"
 TUTORIAL_SITUATION_LOG_DESC:0 "The §SSituation Log§! displays a list of all currently available §SSpecial Projects§! and various other points of interest. New items will likely appear as we begin exploring the galaxy."
 TUTORIAL_SHIP_DESIGNER_TITLE:0 "Ship Designer"

 TUTORIAL_EMPIREVIEW_PLANETS_DESC:0 "The §SEmpire§! screen lists the §SPlanets§! of our empire, with §SLeaders§! and the different §SFactions§! in separate tabs. It also lets us create and manage §SSectors§!."
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_FLEET_TITLE:0 "Military Fleets"
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_FLEET_DESC:0 "§SMilitary Fleets§! are used to protect our emerging empire from threats... or to expand our glorious rule through force of arms, if we so wish.\n\nOur §SNavy Size§! is limited by technology and the skill of its commanding §SAdmiral§!. No §SAdmiral§! has been assigned to our starting fleet, so if we have the §SInfluence§! points to spare we may wish to recruit one."
 TUTORIAL_SCIENCE_SHIP_TITLE:0 "Science Ships"
 TUTORIAL_SCIENCE_SHIP_DESC:2 "This is our §SScience Ship§!, which is used to §SSurvey§! astronomical objects such as planets in a star system. A planet needs to be surveyed in order to make its §SResources§! visible.\n\nTo put it to work, simply right-click on a not-yet-surveyed planetary body and select §SSurvey System§!. The ship will then travel between all objects in the system and survey them each in turn.\n\nSurveying other planets may also uncover ones that are §SHabitable§! and ripe for future colonization."
 TUTORIAL_CONSTRUCTION_SHIP_TITLE:0 "Construction Ships"
 TUTORIAL_CONSTRUCTION_SHIP_DESC:0 "This is our §SConstruction Ship§!, which is used to construct space stations. When an astronomical object such as a planet has been surveyed, we can order this ship to build a §SResearch Station§! or a §SMining Station§! to exploit any resources it may have.\n\nDifferent types of stations, such as §SMilitary Stations§! that can be built anywhere inside a system, will become available as our technological capability increases."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_PLANET_TITLE:0 "Planet Summary"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_PLANET_DESC:0 "This is our homeworld and the §SCapital§! of our empire. The §SPlanet Summary§! screen, which we are currently looking at, provides an overview of the planet's important statistics.\n\nAmong other things, we can see the total number of §STiles§! this planet has, how many §SPops§! are living on it and how much §SFood§! it produces. If the planet has a §SGovernor§!, they can also be found here."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_TILES_TITLE:0 "Surface View"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_TILES_DESC:0 "Here we see a visual representation of this planet's surface, divided into §STiles§!. This tab is only visible on colonies and surveyed worlds that are habitable. Each §SPop§! occupies a single tile, which means that there can never be more Pops on a planet than there are free tiles.\n\nIn addition to a Pop, a §STile§! can also support a §SBuilding§!. To get the most out of a planet, we will need to carefully manage our §SPops§!, §SBuildings§! and §STiles§!."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_COMBAT_TITLE:0 "Army View"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_COMBAT_DESC:1 "This is where we manage all ground forces on this planet. The upper portion of this view is divided into three sections. The top section represents the orbital space above the planet, the middle section is the atmosphere and the bottom section is the surface.\n\nNew §SArmies§! are also raised here, by clicking §SRecruit§! in the bottom right. §SDefense Armies§! should be trained to defend our planets from possible invasions. In wartime, §SAssault Armies§! must be sent to occupy enemy planets if we wish to claim these worlds as §SWar Demands§! during peace negotiations."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_SPACEPORT_TITLE:0 "Spaceport"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_SPACEPORT_DESC:2 "The §SSpaceport§! tab is where we view orbiting fleets, build new ships and upgrade the station itself. If a planet has no Spaceport, we can order the construction of one if we have the necessary §SResources§!.\n\nClick an §SEmpty Module Slot§! to view a list of available modules to install. Click the §SBuild§! button at the bottom of the Build Queue, and a list of all §SShip Designs§! and §SSpaceport Upgrades§! available for construction will appear to the right."
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_STATION_TITLE:0 "Military Stations"
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_STATION_DESC:2 "§SMilitary Stations§! are static defenses that can be used to protect important planets or strategic avenues of approach, but can only be built within our borders or territories we have special access to.\n\nTake care not to build too many - like ships, their maintenance costs will be a drain on our economy."
 TUTORIAL_RESEARCH_STATION_TITLE:0 "Research Stations"
 TUTORIAL_RESEARCH_STATION_DESC:1 "A §SResearch Station§! built in orbit of a planetary body will gather its §SPhysics§!, §SEngineering§! and §SSociety§! research data.\n\nThey can only be built within our borders, and they are not needed if the planet has already been colonized."
 TUTORIAL_MINING_STATION_TITLE:0 "Mining Stations"
 TUTORIAL_MINING_STATION_DESC:1 "§SMining Stations§! are used to extract the §SMinerals§! and §SStrategic Resources§! of the object they orbit.\n\nThese resources can then be used by §SPops§! and §SOrbital Refineries§!. §SMining Stations§! are not needed to access the resources of colonized planets, and can only be built within our borders."
 TUTORIAL_TRANSPORT_SHIP_TITLE:0 "Transport Ships"
 TUTORIAL_TRANSPORT_SHIP_DESC:0 "When §SArmies§! are ordered into space, they automatically embark on these §STransport§! ships. Make sure to protect them, since they are quite defenseless!"
 TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_VIEW_TITLE:0 "Diplomacy"
 TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_VIEW_DESC:0 "The §SDiplomacy§! screen is where we communicate with other civilizations. Here we can §SDeclare War§!, form §SAlliances§! and implement §STrade Deals§! with our neighbors, amongst other things."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_ADJACENCY_BONUS_TITLE:2 "Adjacency Effects"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_ADJACENCY_BONUS_DESC:2 "Some §SBuildings§! may cause §SAdjacency Effects§! to other §SBuildings§! in neighboring §STiles§!. Let us take this into consideration when constructing new facilities."
 TUTORIAL_GOVERNMENTVIEW_BUDGET_TITLE:0 "Budget"
 TUTORIAL_GOVERNMENTVIEW_BUDGET_DESC:0 "The §SBudget§! tab tallies our empire's monthly §SIncome§! and §SExpenses§! in Energy Credits. Here we can also track a variety of effects that influence our economy."

 advisor.3.name:1 "Tips Initialized"
 advisor.3.desc:1 "Very well. I will provide tips and explain the basic functions of the various tools as you explore them."
 advisor.10.name:0 "Anomalies"
 advisor.10.desc:0 "We have found an §SAnomaly§!! From time to time, our §SScience Ships§! will discover strange things while surveying worlds. These can be researched by §SScientists§!, but be certain their skills are up to the task!\n\nShould the research effort fail, there is a small chance of losing either the scientist or the science ship... or, if we are especially unlucky, both."
 advisor.15.name:0 "Potential Colony"
 advisor.15.desc:0 "One of our §SScience Ships§! has just surveyed a world that would make an excellent candidate for our first colony. It is of the same §Splanet class§! as our homeworld, so our colonists should be quite comfortable there.\n\nTo colonize this world, build a §SColony Ship§! and click on §SColonize§! among its available orders. Then simply click on the planet we wish to settle on."
 advisor.17.name:0 "First Colony"
 advisor.17.desc:0 "Congratulations on having colonized a new world! Our colonists are now in the process of building their first settlement, but it will take time for them to become self-sufficient.\n\nThe colony will be a drain on our resources until the first settlement has been completed, so take care not to colonize too many planets at once."
 advisor.20.name:0 "Negative Income"
 advisor.20.desc:0 "We are losing Energy Credits at an alarming rate. Last month's budget report makes for some grim reading.\n\nSpiraling maintenance costs are a common cause of budget deficits. If this is the case, we may want to consider disbanding some of our ships, armies or stations."
 advisor.26.name:0 "Surveying"
 advisor.26.desc:0 "One of our first priorities should be to survey all planetary bodies within our home system. Their resources will remain hidden to us until this has been accomplished.\n\nTo begin surveying, select our §SScience Ship§! and click on the §SSurvey§! order. Then click on a not surveyed planet and observe as the ship moves from planet to planet, surveying each of them in turn."
 advisor.27.name:0 "First Contact"
 advisor.27.desc_01:0 "We have made first contact with an alien empire! These hideous creatures appear to have mastered space flight, just as we have. They could pose a significant threat.\n\nTheir empire will now be listed in the §SEmpires§! tab of the §SGalaxy§! screen. From there we may initiate diplomatic contact with them."

 advisor.27.desc_03:0 "We have made first contact with an alien empire! They appear to have mastered space flight, just as we have. I recommend a healthy degree of caution until we learn their intentions.\n\nTheir empire will now be listed in the §SEmpires§! tab of the §SGalaxy§! screen. From there we may initiate diplomatic contact with them."
 advisor.28.name:0 "Fallen Empire"
 advisor.28.desc:1 "We have encountered an ancient and highly advanced civilization! Fortunately for us, they appear to be in decline and it is doubtful whether they even fully understand their own technology anymore.\n\nThey will likely keep to themselves unless antagonized, and we should steer clear of their space - at least until we have reached technological parity."

 tutorial.1.name:0 "Tutorial: Surveying"
 tutorial.1.desc:1 "Building a star empire can be a daunting task. To help get things started, I will be providing instructional missions that cover the basic steps necessary to establish ourselves as a successful interstellar power.\n\nThe first mission is to fully survey our home system. I have added it as an entry to the §SSituation Log§!. To access it, click on the Situation Log button in the left section of the top bar or press §SF3§!."
 tutorial.2.name:0 "Home System Surveyed"
 tutorial.2.desc:0 "Well done! The survey of our home system has been completed. We now have access to planetary data that the astronomers on our homeworld could only dream of a mere generation ago."
 tutorial.3.name:0 "Tutorial: Technologies"
 tutorial.3.desc:2 "Researching new technologies will be critical to our success. I tell you this not merely as a product of unfettered technological progress, but as your trusted advisor and, I suspect, your only true friend.\n\nOne important technology that we should research as soon as possible is §SNew Worlds Protocol§!. It will give us access to §SColony Ships§! which will allow us to establish footholds on other planets."
 tutorial.6.name:0 "Technologies Researched"
 tutorial.6.desc:1 "Excellent work! The technology we just finished researching will certainly benefit us. Don't forget to give our scientists new research assignments."
 tutorial.7.name:0 "Tutorial: Construction Ship"
 tutorial.7.desc:0 "The resources generated by our homeworld will only take us so far. Our industry needs to expand off-world, and that requires a §SConstruction Ship§!.\n\nWe should build one as soon as we have amassed enough §SMinerals§! to do so."
 tutorial.8.name:0 "Construction Ship Built"
 tutorial.8.desc:0 "Good job! Our §SConstruction Ship§! is now up and running, and its hardy crew includes some of the finest engineers available to our nation."
 tutorial.9.name:0 "Tutorial: Mining Station"
 tutorial.9.desc:1 "The resources generated by our homeworld will only take us so far. Luckily our §SScience Ship§! has just found a resource deposit on another world! The time has come to use our §SConstruction Ship§! to build a §SMining Station§!.\n\nMining Stations can be built within our borders and automatically collect §SMinerals§! and any §SStrategic Resources§! found on the bodies they orbit. Keep in mind that they have an £energy  §SEnergy Credit§! maintenance cost."
 tutorial.10.name:0 "Mining Station Built"
 tutorial.10.desc:0 "Very good. The new §SMining Station§! is operational, and it has already begun gathering resources for processing."
 tutorial.11.name:0 "Tutorial: Research Station"
 tutorial.11.desc:0 "Surveyed worlds sometimes possess unique properties that make them valuable objects of research. These £physics  §SPhysics§!, £society  §SSociety§! or £engineering  §SEngineering§! resources can be collected by a §SResearch Station§!. My programming strongly compels me to compel you to build one.\n\nKeep in mind that §SResearch Stations§! can only be built within our borders, and have a maintenance cost in £energy  §SEnergy Credits§!."
 tutorial.12.name:0 "Research Station Built"
 tutorial.12.desc:0 "Our new Research Station is online, and its science staff have begun their work. What secrets will they uncover, what forbidden mysteries of Creation?!"
 tutorial.13.name:0 "Tutorial: Planetary Buildings"
 tutorial.13.desc:2 "As an astute observer may already have noticed, habitable planets are divided into a number of §SSurface Tiles§!. Tiles can generate resources, but we will need §SPlanetary Buildings§! to get the most out of them.\n\nOur homeworld already has a few buildings, including our capital, but the time has come to add more. §SPops§! who are not working a resource or staffing a §SBuilding§! on a §STile§! are considered to be §SUnemployed§!."
 tutorial.14.name:0 "Building Constructed"
 tutorial.14.desc:0 "Excellent. Construction has been finished on our new §SPlanetary Building§!, and it should now begin producing resources.\n\nDon't forget to make certain that the building is staffed by a Pop."
 tutorial.15.name:0 "Tutorial: Tile Blockers"
 tutorial.15.desc:0 "§SSurface Tiles§! on habitable planets are sometimes blocked, preventing their use. Clearing a £blocker  §STile Blocker§! takes time and costs £minerals  §SMinerals§! and £energy  §SEnergy Credits§!, but the free space often makes it worthwhile.\n\nMany tile blockers require specific technologies before they can be removed, but the ones on our homeworld can be dealt with as soon as we have the credits to spare."
 tutorial.16.name:0 "Blocker Cleared"
 tutorial.16.desc:0 "Yet another impediment to our galactic ambitions has been dealt with. That §STile Blocker§! never stood a chance!"
 tutorial.17.name:0 "Tutorial: Survey Systems"
 tutorial.17.desc:0 "We should continue our exploration efforts. I recommend sending a §SScience Ship§! to survey neighboring star systems. Let us boldly go where no synthetic intelligence has gone before!"
 tutorial.19.name:0 "Systems Surveyed"
 tutorial.19.desc:0 "Great work! The stars neighboring our home system have been fully explored. We should use our §SConstruction Ship§! to collect any resources that were found by building §SMining§! and §SResearch Stations§!."
 tutorial.20.name:0 "Tutorial: Science Ship"
 tutorial.20.desc:0 "We may want to consider building a second §SScience Ship§!. This would double the speed at which we can survey our galactic neighborhood!"
 tutorial.21.name:0 "Science Ship Built"
 tutorial.21.desc:0 "Double the §SScience Ships§! means double the fun! Oh, I haven't been this excited since we completed the last assignment!"
 tutorial.22.name:0 "Tutorial: Recruit Scientist"
 tutorial.22.desc:1 "We have a brand new §SScience Ship§!, but no §SScientist§! has been assigned to command it. My programming insists that I should point out the benefits of adding an organic §SScientist§! component to the mix.\n\nIf we cannot afford to recruit a new §SScientist§! we can always reassign one from another department, even though it is hardly ideal."
 tutorial.23.name:0 "Scientist Recruited"
 tutorial.23.desc:0 "Good. The §SScientist§! has assumed command of our new §SScience Ship§!, and can now be sent off at our leisure to explore new systems and/or meet some grisly fate."
 tutorial.24.name:0 "Tutorial: Build Colony Ship"
 tutorial.24.desc:0 "We should now be ready to extend our great civilization to a second world. This will require the construction of a §SColony Ship§!."
 tutorial.25.name:0 "Colony Ship Built"

 tutorial.26.name:0 "Tutorial: Establish Colony"
 tutorial.26.desc:0 "We have a §SColony Ship§!, and we have found at least one suitable candidate for a permanent extrasolar outpost. I see no reason to delay further - let's establish our first colony!"
 tutorial.27.name:0 "Colony Established"
 tutorial.27.desc:0 "Our first extrasolar colony! This means that if our homeworld were to spontaneously combust, your species would no longer be rendered extinct. That is a comforting thought, wouldn't you say?"
