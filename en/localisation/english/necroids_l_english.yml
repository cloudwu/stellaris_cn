A pause stretched in the meeting before pandemonium erupted. Every assembled executive demanded to know how this might impact their reanimated workers supply.\n\nAfter some more analysis, it turned out that this was only an extraordinarily rare case. Only the deceased whose bodies had lasted a whole century had managed to pay off their debts - a minuscule number, on the grand scale. Our galactic corporation would barely notice if they were to be put to rest."
