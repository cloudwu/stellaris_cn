At first, we thought it was simply missing its connection with the rest of its kind, until our Telepaths told us that it had been in communication with them, speaking of a 'Hole in the Void'.\n\nWhat it meant by this we found out only when a team of scientists researching Prethoryn intergalactic travel methods discovered a discrepancy in our astronomical database. While charting the likely path the Prethoryn had been following, they found that a small spiral galaxy some 30 million light-years distant from our own was... missing.\n\nThe galaxy, discovered and studied during the early space era of our species, is simply no longer emanating any form of light observable by our instruments. This bizarre and unexpected discovery sent our scientists into a scramble to try and explain what could cause an entire galaxy to simply vanish from the sky.\n\nTwo explanations emerged: Either the stars of the galaxy simply went out, all at once, or there is something, something so vast as to eclipse an entire galaxy, blocking its light from reaching us. Both theories seem equally implausible, and many have simply decried them as ludicrous, preferring to think that the missing galaxy never existed at all, invented by some erroneous use of a primitive telescope. Nonetheless, a palpable sense of dread and foreboding surrounds the whole incident..."
