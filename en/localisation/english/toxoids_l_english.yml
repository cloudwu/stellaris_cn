 #Knights of the Toxic God

 origin_toxic_knights:0 "Knights of the Toxic God"
 origin_toxic_knights_desc:2 "Centuries ago, this species' homeworld was visited by a Toxic Entity. The ecological catastrophe that followed ruined half the world, but allowed an early unification of the survivors in their reverence for the Toxic God. An Order of Knights has been created to search for the Toxic God, and although many things have changed, the quest continues."

 START_SCREEN_TOXIC_KNIGHTS:1 "Long ago, our planet was divided. Petty kings squabbled constantly, and our population bled for their vain ambitions. But with the coming of the first High King, all of this changed. Their inspired leadership forged a kingdom without equal.\n\nAbove all else, the High King was pious. War was waged against any who denied their God, but still the heretics persisted. The King's prayers were answered when the Toxic God visited our world. Though its time among us was brief, its baneful influence poisoned the lands of the unbelievers. Any who survived pledged fealty to the High King. For the first time, our world was unified.\n\nThe Toxic God soon left us, but the King, determined to find it, founded an order of knights. For centuries, these valiant souls searched tirelessly, but to no avail. The Toxic God had long since departed from our world. The next chapter of the Quest would be written in the stars. With the use of powerful relics, it was the Order that built our Empire's first orbital station. A mighty Keep, it would become the springboard from which they plunged ever deeper into the cosmos."

 ##The Quest
 toxoids.7006:0 "The Tale of Knight [questing_knight_1.GetName]: Banishment"
 toxoids.7006.desc:1 ""Knight [questing_knight_1.GetName]. Thy reckless behavior almost brought death upon five of your fellow knights. Thou art of pure heart and thy goals art noble, but transgressions against the Order cannot be overlooked."\n\nThe Knight Commander was stern and severe. Around him, all the knights were present, either in the flesh or via holocomms. They stood silently as the Commander spoke.\n\n"By my powers, I strip thee of knighthood, and banish thee from the Order. May fate have mercy upon thee."\n\n[questing_knight_1.GetName] bowed, deposited the insignia of the order on the hangar's floor, then turned without a word and climbed aboard a small ship.\n\nLater chronicles would report that Banished knight [questing_knight_1.GetName] knew the sentence to be fair, but it did little to ease [questing_knight_1.GetHisHer] grief. When one's whole life has been in service of the Order, to be cut out from it is like losing a limb.\n\nAs [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] had done so many times before, [questing_knight_1.GetName] flew out of the Keep's Hangar, and into the great beyond. This time, there would be no return."
 toxoids.7006.a:0 "Good luck out there, [questing_knight_1.GetName]."
 toxoids.7007:0 "The Tale of Knight [questing_knight_1.GetName]: The Nebula"
 toxoids.7007.desc:2 "In banishment, [questing_knight_1.GetName] was left adrift. Stories tell of an aimless errance across the stars, until at last a message came from [questing_knight_1.GetHisHer] squire: "Master. I hope fate treats thee well. I have sorted through data from thy last quest, as thou commandeth. Thou shall find coordinates attached to this message. I know not if thou shall find this useful now... Prithee be careful, thou were a most righteous master, and I hope to see thee again."\n\nMoved by these words, [questing_knight_1.GetName] was spurred into action. If [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] could return to the Order with something of value, [questing_knight_1.GetHisHer] honor might yet be restored.\n\nThe coordinates led [questing_knight_1.GetHimHer] deep into a nebula. Nested in the ambient mists was a lone station, a fortified structure that seemed pulled out of a dream. [questing_knight_1.GetName] stepped into a derelict interior, haunted by the bones of long dead lifeforms and protected by a phalanx of sentry droids. Hot headed and impatient, [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] rushed to meet the metal guardians. Three times [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] charged, and three times [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] [questing_knight_1.GetWasWere] driven back. The droids' motion sensors proved unerring. But strength is not the only weapon of a knight, and though [questing_knight_1.GetName] often overlooked cunning and patience, this time, a plan began to form in [questing_knight_1.GetHisHer] mind."
 toxoids.7007.a:0 "Think, [questing_knight_1.GetName], think! "
 toxoids.7008:0 "The Tale of Knight [questing_knight_1.GetName]: Statues"
 toxoids.7008.desc:1 "Alone in a long abandoned station, beset by sentry droids, [questing_knight_1.GetName] devised a plan: knowing if [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] could somehow avoid the detection of the droid's motion sensors, eventually they would need to recharge. The machines were formidable, but not cunning. Patience, not strength, would be the way to victory this day.\n\nSlowly, with long stops and fitful starts, [questing_knight_1.GetName] progressed through the station. At last [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] reached the charging stations. With careful deliberation, [questing_knight_1.GetName] severed the power cables. In the same moment, [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] became aware of a towering droid in the entryway.\n\nDetection would mean that the rest of the phalanx would join the fight, and in such a confined space, death was certain. [questing_knight_1.GetName] stood by the door, motionless as the machine placed itself on a charging station, the red eye of its detectors glowing menacingly. It would eventually run out of power, but that would take time. One by one the other droids returned to their stations.\n\nThe chronicles tell that knight [questing_knight_1.GetName] stood immobile for seven days and seven nights, until the last droid had deactivated. With the station's droids reduced to lifeless statues, [questing_knight_1.GetName] was free to pursue the object of [questing_knight_1.GetHisHer] quest: the location of an ancient ship that once crossed the path of the Toxic God."
 toxoids.7008.a:0 "Patience is a virtue."
 toxoids.7009:0 "The Tale of Knight [questing_knight_1.GetName]: The Sage"
 toxoids.7009.desc:1 "Cast out from the Order, [questing_knight_1.GetName] made [questing_knight_1.GetHisHer] way deep into a nebula. On a previous quest, [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] and [questing_knight_1.GetHisHer] squire met a sage living on a secluded moon. Great was their knowledge, and greater their powers, for they belonged to a coven of 'Shroud Witches'. [questing_knight_1.GetName] was in need of guidance, and hoped to find solace in the sage's advice.\n\nStories tell that [questing_knight_1.GetName] renounced [questing_knight_1.GetHisHer] weapons and spent months amongst the sage's students. On this moon, the values of the Order mattered little, and while chivalry was respected, it was not an end in itself. Many were the lessons imparted by the sage, but the ambition of [questing_knight_1.GetName] was an unquenchable thirst. The Quest called, and [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] would answer once more.\n\nIt was late at night when the sage came to visit [questing_knight_1.GetName]. They handed back the weapons that the knight had abandoned, along with a data crystal. "Thy squire is in grave danger. Thou art knight no more, but the young one's life rests in thy hands. Go now. The Perilous Nebula awaits.""

 toxoids.7010.desc:1 "The information led [questing_knight_1.GetName] to an asteroid field. Anchored to one of the largest rocks was the 'Damsel', an ancient corvette. Next to it, another of the Order's ships betrayed the presence of a knight. Worryingly, its distress beacon was active.\n\n[questing_knight_1.GetName] entered cautiously, stepping into the theater of a brutal fight. Weapon impacts both ancient and recent littered the walls, and fragments of robots were strewn around. A little further in: the lifeless remains of a knight of the Order, and the trail of a wounded [Root.GetSpeciesName] beckoned [questing_knight_1.GetFirstName].\n\nDeep within, the banished knight found a body in stasis: [questing_knight_1.GetHisHer] squire's body. Monitors showed that that young [questing_knight_2.GetName] was wounded, but stable. However when [questing_knight_1.GetName] approached, the ship's security systems whirred online. A chilling voice echoed: "Step back, marauder. Thou art not welcome aboard.""

 toxoids.7013.desc:0 "Knight, sayeth thou? Were thou related? If so, accept my condolences and another apology. I thought the intruder to be a marauder. When I asked that they leave the ship, they became highly aggressive. Several of my maintenance droids were destroyed trying to stop them."
 toxoids.7013.a:0 "And my squire? What art thou doing to [questing_knight_2.GetHimHer]?"
 toxoids.7014.desc:1 "Thy squire made me realize the mistake I'd made. [questing_knight_2.GetHeSheCap] had been wounded in the fight and lost consciousness soon after. I placed [questing_knight_2.GetHimHer] in this medical stasis so that [questing_knight_2.GetHeShe] may heal. Ever since my crew was abducted by marauders, I have been very lonely here. I hoped to enjoy thy squire's company for a moment after [questing_knight_2.GetHeShe] healed."
 toxoids.7014.a:0 "What did the marauders do?"
 toxoids.7015.desc:1 "I was hacked and taken offline when they approached, but once I overcame the hex cast upon me, the security footage showed them capturing my crew after a fierce fight. They have probably taken them into slavery. My databanks indicate that Marauders often do that.\n\nAll this was... long ago. It took ages to repair myself after the hack. Many parts of my memory banks are still locked even to me because of it... But tell me. If thou art a knight, what is thy quest?"
 toxoids.7015.a:1 "We are looking for the §YToxic God§!."
 toxoids.7016.desc:0 "I have multiple records of encounters with toxic spacefaring entities. Unfortunately, most of my memories are locked. I can access the index of the records, but not the information itself. If I help thee, I want thee to take me off this ship. I long for contact with other sentient beings. Wouldst thou bring me to thy lord?"
 toxoids.7016.a:1 "Certainly, fair AI."

 toxoids.7011:1 "The Tale of Knight [questing_knight_1.GetName]: Homecoming"
 toxoids.7011.desc:3 "The return to the Order's Keep was momentous. There, within the Great Hall, $NAME_Sinople$ revealed that they had contact with an entity very similar to the Toxic God sought by the Order. However, much of the AI's memory was encrypted and would require a lot of work before the Order could access it.\n\nAs for [questing_knight_1.GetName]: [questing_knight_1.GetHeShe] not only put [questing_knight_1.GetHisHer] life on the line by coming back, but also managed to bring back a tangible clue and save squire [questing_knight_2.GetName]. For this, the Lord Commander took the decision to lift the banishment, and dubbed [questing_knight_1.GetName] a knight again."
