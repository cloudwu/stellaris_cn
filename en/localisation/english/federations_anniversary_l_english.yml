 fedev.605.desc:0 "The routing of various goods is the life-blood of our prosperous trade federation. But so far each empire has relied on their own logistic standards with regards to container design, loading procedures, and shipping pipelines.\n\nIn order to maximize efficiency, a new trial project will commence in a few years - one that aims to investigate and trial a new, specific shipping standard that would be applied to all members of the federation.\n\nParticipation requires a system with at least §H50 Trade Value§! flowing through it. Furthermore, the existence of an §HOffworld Trading Company§! would mean increased statistical data, and so is encouraged.\n\nDue to the vast scope of this project, some costs will apply. But it's for the greater good. That is to say: more future profit.\n\nEvery member of the federation is strongly encouraged to participate."

 ### Militarist Joint Operation by Pierre du Plessis ###

 federations2.100.name:0 "The Federation Fleet"
 federations2.100.desc:0 "The [Root.Federation.GetName] represents a powerful force on the galactic stage; however, its fleets are divided and operate under a disparate set of organizational structures. Recently, several influential military experts from across the federation have raised concerns about our ability to face a well-coordinated and powerful enemy.\n\nTo rectify this, they have drawn up plans for a federation-wide series of military exercises to build cohesion within our militaries and hone the skills of our crews. Under their plans, detachments from each of our fleets would move to specific locations in our allies' territories and perform a series of complex maneuvers, coordinating with other participating fleets to ensure that the operations are executed simultaneously. Successfully holding these exercises would be a significant commitment for our armed forces but would appreciably boost our federation's military readiness."
