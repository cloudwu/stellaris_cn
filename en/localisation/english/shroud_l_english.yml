 # Good luck event 1
 shroud.500.title: "Unconventional Breakthrough"
 shroud.500.desc: "Promising new research from our leading institutions has reached an unexpected breakthrough. By pure chance, the routine standardization of our instruments proved a theory that was long thought to be a fundamental miscalculation. We can now revisit what was once thought to be fringe science."
 HOW_FORTUITOUS: "How fortuitous."
 shroud.500.tt: "Insight gained on a random technology: §G$@good_luck_event_1_insight|0%$§!"

 # Good luck event 2
 shroud.507.title: "Unearthed Mother Lode"
 shroud.507.desc: "A system of ore-rich natural caverns previously thought to have collapsed entirely, has been fortuitously rediscovered on §H[This.GetName]§!.\n\nAfter a careful hazard assessment, we are confident that these tunnels can support significant mineral exploitation with the expansion of existing mining efforts."

 # Good luck event 3
 shroud.512.title: "[This.GetNewfoundFertilityTitle]"
 shroud.512.title_default: "Newfound Fertility"
 shroud.512.title_anglers: "Undiscovered Reef"
 shroud.512.desc: "A routine land survey has revealed that the soil quality on §H[This.GetName]§! has drastically improved in recent years across large swathes of the planet.\n\nWe believe that many areas once thought incapable of supporting agriculture can now be used to expand our farming efforts."
 shroud.512.desc_anglers: "A fishing vessel has discovered a concealed reef in the oceans of §H[This.GetName]§!. The region, previously believed to be deserted and infertile, is in fact supporting a thriving ecosystem of harvestable fauna."

 # Good luck event 4
 shroud.517.title: "Geothermal Vents"
 shroud.517.desc: "Following a tectonic shift, a fissure has opened under a large groundwater reservoir on §H[This.GetName]§!. The heat from the planet's mantle is boiling the trapped water deposit, causing geothermal vents to form on the surface.\n\nThis natural phenomenon provides us with an opportunity to expand the colony's energy infrastructure with new geothermal power plants and heat pumps."

 # Good luck event 5
 shroud.522.title: "Quantum Particle Stream Discovered"
 shroud.522.desc: "An anomalous loop of subatomic elements has spontaneously appeared in §H[This.GetName]§!. This quantum particle stream displays a variety of rare sub-particulate interactions every second, providing astonishing data on the innate nature of quantum dynamics.\n\nFocused study of this quantum field would allow us to better understand the fundamental building blocks of our universe."

 # Good luck event 6
 shroud.527.title: "Interdimensional Echo Discovered"
 shroud.527.desc: "Our [From.GetResearchers] have detected a concentration of isochronal signals in the §H[This.GetName]§! system.\n\nInitial analysis indicated that these signals have been transmitted from a dimension beyond our own. Early translations suggest that these messages relate to logical principles and philosophical quandaries. Perhaps this is an attempt at intellectual enrichment from entities beyond our comprehension.\n\nIf we establish a direct feed with these signals we can continue to monitor their revelations."

 # Good luck event 7
 shroud.532.title: "Advanced Wreckage Discovered"
 shroud.532.desc: "A derelict ship has appeared in §H[This.GetName]§!. [From.GetQuantumParticleStreamDiscoveredExtra]\n\nWe have deduced that the ship remained undetected in this system for millennia, only revealing itself after its solar energy generator malfunctioned. No life signs are onboard, and we have already begun careful disassembly of the vessel to learn as much as we can."
 shroud.532.extra: "The irreparably damaged vessel was able to generate some form of invisibility field and is generally far more tactically advanced than our own fleets."
 shroud.532.extra_first_contact: "The irreparably damaged vessel was using unparalleled levels of cloaking technology."
 shroud.532.a: "A gift from the stars."

 # Good luck event 8
 shroud.537.title: "Geothermic Metallurgy"
 shroud.537.desc: "Geothermal activity has become extremely volatile deep below the surface of §H[This.GetName]§!. Underground discharges of magma have risen up through the planetary crust into a series of unexcavated ore deposits.\n\nThis geological phenomenon has superheated some of the unexploited minerals, refining veins of metallic ore into solid alloys. As such, mining operations on the planet will now produce fragments of workable metal."

 # Good luck event 9
 shroud.543.title: "Abandoned Cruiser"
 shroud.543.desc: "A deserted combat vessel has been detected drifting through the §H[From.GetName]§! system. The ship's design does not resemble that of any known empire, bearing no recognizable flag or insignia.\n\nAfter an extensive appraisal and some minor repairs, our [This.GetEngineerPlural] have declared that the ship is now fit for active service."
