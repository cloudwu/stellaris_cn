 STORMS_ANOM_ANTS: "The Organic Comet"
 STORMS_ANOM_ANTS_DESC: "A cosmic storm has left behind a comet of unusual composition. It appears to be made of organic material. Our [solar_system.Owner.GetScientistPlural] are keen to investigate."
 cstorms.5020.name: "Antsteroid"
 cstorms.5020.desc: "The comet was revealed to be a giant nest filled with tiny insects. The tail of the comet is not outgassed ice, but rather exhaust from chemical processes occurring deep inside the hive.\n\nThe outer layer of the nest is composed of dead individuals, protecting the living inside from the harsh conditions of space. We've also picked up several types of fungi living in and around the nest. There is a complex symbiosis at work here, with the fungi living off of the exhaust gasses and the insects feeding on the fungi."
 cstorms.5020.a: "Harvest the nest."
 cstorms.5020.b: "Look but don't touch."

 STORMS_ANOM_STAT: "Confusing Composition"
 STORMS_ANOM_STAT_DESC: "This orbiting object has been left behind by a passing cosmic storm. It looks like a space station but scans of its structural composition is returning most confusing results. We recommend investigating."
 cstorms.5030.name: "Stationary Apocalypse"
 cstorms.5030.desc: "[Root.Owner.GetScientistPluralCapital] report that much of this space station is constructed from everyday stationary objects, barely holding it together. Deeper into the structure, the materials transition from metal alloys to plastics and other substances.\n\nInside the heart of the construct we found a machine, still in the process of efficiently deconstructing organic material and shaping it into the very items encountered so far.\n\nAfter running a DNA simulation model, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have been forced to conclude that the material likely came from the former inhabitants of this outpost."

 STORMS_ANOM_BRAIN: "Existentialist Dissipation"
 STORMS_ANOM_BRAIN_DESC: "Ever since a $shroud_storm$ raged through this system, we've been receiving strange signals. However, as soon as our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] try to answer this cacophony of hails, it dissipates again. They recommend sending a science vessel."
 cstorms.5025.name: "Brainstorm"
 cstorms.5025.desc: "We could never have anticipated our discovery: brains. Organic, squishy central processing organs from all sorts of species. Hundreds and hundreds of them, all linked together and suspended inside a large balloon-like capsule. It appears to be derelict, left floating in the depths of space after a recent $shroud_storm$ dissipated.\n\nThe capsule contains an incredible array of sensors attached to the brains and the balloon, and there is also a communication module, capable of hailing ships and transmitting information, just as it did to us.\n\nIt seems likely that the brains themselves contacted us, explaining the cacophony of messages. Our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] think the construction was designed to measure organic responses to a $shroud_storm$. Given the unstable psionic residue within these floating minds, attempting to interface them would only lead to disaster."

#Terrestrial Telescopes
 terrestial_telescope_category: "Terrestrial Telescopes"
 terrestial_telescope_category_desc: "Scans performed by the [fleet.GetName] indicate the presence of a derelict space station in the [From.GetStarName] System.\n\nIt looks like it was deposited there by a passing cosmic storm. Life signs return negative, and there are no power signals of any kind. Two massive telescopes protrude from opposite sides of the station. These optical instruments appear advanced, and far too large relative to the station's size. The technology and architecture are not yet familiar to us.\n\nWe could attempt to reactivate the telescopes, as this could yield some interesting insights."
 cstorms.1605.name: "Terrestrial Telescopes"
 cstorms.1605.desc: "Boarding the station and activating the telescopes took some finessing from our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural], but it was nothing they could not handle. However, the corner of the galaxy the instruments were pointed at showed nothing of note.\n\nSome interesting artifacts were found scattered around the station: detailed images recorded from the telescopes, neatly presented in decorative frames. Every single capture is focussed on cosmic storms, with multiple prints of each storm that has passed through this system. The telescope operator used different angles, zoom levels, and even artistic tilts to show the storms in their best light.\n\nUpon deeper investigation, the artwork is the only interesting find aboard the abandoned station. We will archive them so many future generations can enjoy these images of rare power and beauty."

 STORMS_ANOM_POLYCHROMATIC: "Polychromatic Star"
 STORMS_ANOM_POLYCHROMATIC_DESC: "The passing of a cosmic storm through [from.solar_system.GetName] has transformed the visual appearance of the system's star. In the aftermath of the storm, the star's coronal layer presents as a swirl of ever-changing colors, ejecting polychromatic flares in all directions. The phenomenon warrants further analysis."
 cstorms.5035.name: "$STORMS_ANOM_POLYCHROMATIC$"
 cstorms.5035.desc: "[root.leader.GetName] reports fascinating changes in [From.GetStarName]'s fusion reactions since the passage of the [from.GetAffectedStormType].\n\nIt appears that the storm induced unexpected nuclear reactions within the star's core, resulting in a steady release of [from.GetEarnedResources] from its convective zones.\n\nThese complex and idiosyncratic reactions are producing the unusual polychromatic flaring we have observed. In any case, it will continue to be a source worthy of close study for some time."
 cstorms.5035.a: "Study these new processes."
 cstorms.5035.b: "Harvest these new resources."

 STORMS_ANOM_TRIPLETS: "Asteroid Triplets"
 STORMS_ANOM_TRIPLETS_DESC: "A passing cosmic storm deposited three new asteroids in [from.solar_system.GetName]. These celestial bodies are prone to inexplicable changes of direction, making it impossible to predict their trajectories. Further research is needed."
 cstorms.5040.name: "$STORMS_ANOM_TRIPLETS$"
 cstorms.5040.desc: "[root.leader.GetName] discovered that the asteroids deposited in [from.solar_system.GetName] possess highly unstable magnetic fields, causing them to ricochet haphazardly off the system's existing magnetospheres.\n\n[root.leader.GetName] stabilized them by adding magnetic compensators to each asteroid, regulating their trajectories and thus making them amenable to resource extraction efforts."

 cstorms.5050.name: "Displaced Travelers"
 cstorms.5050.desc: "We have identified the source of the distress signal in §H[from.solar_system.GetName]§! as a heavily damaged but still functioning mercantile vessel.\n\nThe occupants claim they have been knocked a great distance off course by the §H[from.GetAffectedStormType]§!.

 cstorms.5060.name: "$STORMS_COSMIC_SLUDGE$"
 cstorms.5060.desc: "The erratic sensor readings in §H[from.solar_system.GetName]§! are derived from an exceptional debris formation left in the wake of the §H[from.GetAffectedStormType]§!.\n\nThis drifting entity is an amorphous blob of cosmic sludge, forged in the extreme pressures of the storm. Its innumerable constituent elements have formed a uniquely reactive compound.\n\nFocused study of its chemistry could yield valuable astrometeorological insights into the conditions that produced it."
 cstorms.5060.a: "Study its composition."
 cstorms.5060.b: "Break it down."

 STORMS_SHATTERED_SATTELITE: "Shattered Satellite"
 STORMS_SHATTERED_SATTELITE_DESC: "In the aftermath of the §H[from.GetAffectedStormType]§!, an unidentified object has been detected in §H[from.solar_system.GetName]§!. Further analysis of this debris could provide valuable insights."

### Collided Planet Event Chain

 collided_planets_category_desc: "Eons ago two planets collided. In the wake of their demise a unique world was born."

 cs_collided_planet_chain_title: "The Collided Planet"
 cs_collided_planet_chain_desc: "Disaster threatens to shatter the fragile balance of this unique planet."

 cstorms.1200.name: "A Tale of Two Planets"
 cstorms.1200.desc: "From the moment we detected [From.Planet.GetName], its mere existence has been a source of fascination.\n\nIt is not the collision of two celestial objects that is unusual, as the galaxy is a vast and chaotic place. However, in all known instances of such an impact, one or both of the bodies in question was destroyed.\n\nThe collision that formed [From.Planet.GetName] took place millions of years ago, and yet these two worlds maintain a strange equilibrium, and have even formed a life-sustaining atmosphere in the process."
 cstorms.1205.name: "Precarious Balance"
 cstorms.1205.desc: "The situation on the so-called "collided planet" has turned out to be far more precarious than anticipated. A recent series of earthquakes opened up the old scars around the impact zone, causing a significant amount of magma to erupt from the ground. Various planetary biomes are already beginning to suffer from rising global temperatures and the volcanic ash that clouds the skies.\n\nTo make matters worse, if the joint planets are not stabilized within the next 50 years, our readings predict that tectonic activity will continue to escalate, ultimately causing the complete disintegration of [From.Planet.GetName]!"
 cstorms.1210.name: "Metamorphosis Unchained"
 cstorms.1210.desc: "Our top geologists came together and formed two possible plans to save the [From.Planet.GetName] from succumbing to tectonic terror.\n\nThe first plan is to stabilize the collision. While it would take many centuries to heal the volcanic wound around the impact zone, through careful terrestrial trepanning we can alleviate the pressure on the planet's crust, preventing further tectonic instability. The remaining volcanic byproducts will be used to terraform the planet into a stable biome.\n\nThe second plan is far more ambitious. Instead of alleviating the pressure on the planet's crust, the energy and materials generated by the volcanic eruption could be adapted to a tailored terraforming process.\n\nThis approach allows us to sculpt a multitude of biomes capable of sustaining every type of lifeform, turning this world into a paradise. However, there is a significant chance that this procedure will fail - and could even lead to the complete and utter destruction of this unique stellar body."

While not harmful to their native environment, [From.GetName] is not well suited for colonization with these creatures scurrying about.\n\nOne rather unorthodox method of handling the insects has been proposed. Initial scans show they are edible, so perhaps we have found a new food source? We advise at least investigating the opportunity."

 project_cosmic_storms_crimson_crawlers_DESC: "[From.Planet.GetName] is entirely covered by placid, red insects. The planet could be habitable if the bugs are dealt with. At the same time, they appear to be a good source of food. There may be a path forward here."
 cstorms.1260.name: "Uncommon Cuisine"
 cstorms.1260.desc: "The idea of consuming the crimson crawlers may have seemed preposterous at first, but when a specimen was brought on board, it became far more palatable.\n\nThe insects are a creature of wonder, possessing an extremely advanced nervous system without the benefit of a central processing organ. More importantly, their pale flesh is surprisingly tender and moist, and even when consumed raw, the vermillion-hued exoskeleton was deemed both crispy and delightful.\n\nThe question remains as to whether the bugs would better serve as research material or as a delectable source of food. Cooking them might provide more flavor and fun, but eating them as they come will be quicker and easier, especially if paired with the appropriate condiment."

 cstorms.1310.desc: "We are receiving strange reports from the [This.GetName]. Apparently, the last cosmic storm raging in that sector revealed a ship of unknown origin. Bearing no call sign, it somehow cruised through the tempest as if entirely unaffected by the surrounding violence.\n\nIt did not respond to hails, and as soon as the storm dissipated, so did the vessel itself. This might have been dismissed as instrument artifacting, but the visual evidence spoke for itself.\n\nCould this be a display of incredibly advanced technology, or is there something more ominous at play? We will be sure to report back any occurrences of this mysterious vessel."

 cstorms.1313.desc: "One of the research stations in [This.GetName] came to us with a startling report: During the last cosmic storm, a strange ship had almost collided with the outpost. Visual reports show it was the same ominous vessel first reported some time ago.\n\nAccording to the space station, the hulls on the vessel were constructed from a strange amalgamation of organic compounds, calcium minerals and metallic alloys.\n\nNo organic life was detected, leading us to speculate that either this vessel was automated, or had somehow gone rogue.\n\nHowever, the most baffling thing was yet to come: large sections of its propulsion system were clearly shattered by space debris. This vessel should have been dead in space.\n\nIf we assign a science vessel to monitor the next cosmic storm, they might be able to find out more about this mysterious craft."
 cstorms.1313.a: "We have no time for such nonsense."
 cstorms.1316.name: "Whispers in the Tempest"
 cstorms.1316.desc: "In the distance [stormbound_science.GetName] witnessed the ominous ship appearing between the layers of the storm. As it floated by, we detected wild readings emanating from the cosmic tapestry.\n\nThis finally provided an answer to why this ship could not be observed by our sensors: its physical manifestation had been stretched beyond the manifold, as if it had both entered and not entered a wormhole. It was likely due to the hyperdimensional origins of cosmic storms that the ship managed to return to our space.\n\nKnowing this, we should be able to detect the next occurrence, and perhaps pull this craft back to our reality."

Identifying herself as B'Tiin, her tale was a fascinating one.\n\nShe was once a renowned officer, a true paragon of an organization known as the Convention of Benefactors. While on patrol, she and her crew were caught inside a cosmic storm, and in a daring bid for survival, she made the decision to overcharge the ship's 'Breach Drive.' This experimental technology had never been tested, and the vessel and its crew was trapped within the storm's hyperdimensional field.\n\nHer story finished, a small container was released from the decimated ship. Inside was a collection of documents. "Take these home," B'Tiin requested, after which the transmission ended, and the ship disappeared into the spatial manifold.\n\nThe documents are written in a foreign script, and will take some time to decipher."
 cstorms.1320.a: "Begin the translation."
 cstorms.1321.name: "Letters From The Manifold"
 cstorms.1321.desc: "The contents of the strange container have been deciphered. One document contained a schematic of the ship's so-called Breach Drive. While still beyond our own technology, careful study of the principles behind its construction have already improved our understanding of hyperspatial travel.\n\nLess beneficial perhaps, but more affecting, were the translations of personal letters. Each is addressed to a loved one, speaking of fondness, hope, and regret.\n\nIt seems B'Tiin's intention was to give her crew one last chance to reach out. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing where to deliver these letters. Making them available to our own people could at least preserve their strange legacy. Alternatively, it might be wise to destroy them. Knowledge of strange ships and ghostly letters may be unsettling."
 cstorms.1321.a: "Archive the letters for posterity."

 cstorms.1500.name: "But They're Cute!"
 cstorms.1500.desc: "From the moment the creature was discovered, its impact was undeniable, inspiring love and devotion among us almost instantaneously. Its four bulging eyes displayed innocence and invited anyone to stroke its soft, cloud-like fur. It seems particularly attached to [Root.GetLeaderName], spending most of its time on [Leader.GetHisHer] lap enjoying [Leader.GetHisHer] affections, not showing any signs of aggression or danger. It is as if it was perfectly engineered to be as inoffensive as possible.\n\nStill, some skeptics have pointed out how irresponsible it would be to keep a previously undiscovered life form aboard the ship without prior approval. [Root.GetLeaderName] vouched that it is definitely probably safe, but has agreed to request a formal investigation."

 cstorms.1505.name: "Biological Marvel"
 cstorms.1505.desc: "The docile hexapod did not need to be sedated or even coerced into being prodded and scanned. It seemed strangely agreeable. The crew nicknamed it Gurr, after the soft noise it makes when petted.\n\nWe have concluded that Gurr is an omnivore, and that its fur consists of familiar and very soft keratin-based filaments. But the true marvel and mystery takes place inside the adorable creature: it achieves total cell renewal within a month. This includes its nervous system, meaning that it could regrow fully functional body parts within a matter of days.\n\nIt seems unlikely something with such a sophisticated biological makeup is a product of natural evolution. We have never before seen anything like it, and cannot be certain of its temperament. Despite its apparent docility, it could turn on us at any moment. That said, since its appearance, [Root.GetLeaderName] seems more motivated to work than ever.\n\nWhat shall we do with Gurr? Can we keep it?"

From now until the end, it shall be ours, and it shall be named Gurr."
 cstorms.1510.a: "Splendid!"
 cstorms.1515.name: "The end of Gurr"
 cstorms.1515.desc: "Given its unusual and clearly genetically engineered body, the creature could not stay aboard the science vessel. The risk of it adversely affecting the crew, or an aggrieved owner appearing to demand its return was simply too great. The deed was done swiftly and mercifully. In an instant, its soft "gurr" was silenced forever.\n\nWhile understandable, this decision has prompted an emotional backlash from [Root.GetLeaderName] and the crew. It will take some time to get over the loss of this adorable freak of nature."
 cstorms.1515.a: "There was no other choice."
 cstorms.1520.name: "The end of Gurr?"
 cstorms.1520.desc: "Neutralizing the adorable creature was meant to be the end of it, but its remarkable regenerative characteristics seemed to have gone further than we could have guessed.\n\nNot too long after its demise, two identical copies of the creature were spawned from its apparently lifeless tissue. Even after our decision to terminate its progenitor's life, the resulting lifeforms are not showing any signs of aggression.\n\nWe shall leave it at this, rather than risk creating an army of Gurrs. [Root.GetLeaderName] and the crew have expressed their delight at being allowed to keep the pair."

Sadly, no one aboard their vessel noticed [event_target:the_imitator.GetHeShe] was missing.\n\nStranded for months, [event_target:the_imitator.GetHeShe] used what little tech [event_target:the_imitator.GetHeShe] could find aboard [event_target:the_imitator.GetHerHis] pod to mimic the energy signals of passing ships as a type of lure. However, even this failed to attract help. Worst of all, a cosmic storm took hold of the pod, dragging it lightyears from its home system. Driven to extremes by loneliness and fear, [event_target:the_imitator.GetHeShe] concocted a plan to pose as a missing crew member of any ship that happened by.

 cstorms.1275.name: "Brand New Bemusement"
 cstorms.1275.desc: "Despite having been dragged across the galaxy by the cosmic storm, the orbital complex suffered very little harm. We found the living and commercial spaces of the habitat in almost perfect condition. Not a single bit of dust laid atop the surface that would betray a previous occupancy, as if it had never before been used.\n\nInside the central control hub we were greeted by a bewildering input system: dials with no explanation, levers with inconsistent settings and a great amount of buttons flashing a whole spectrum of colors at seemingly random intervals. Fortunately, we eventually came across a manual. Once this is successfully translated, we are confident we can reactivate the habitat."
 cstorms.1280.name: "Manual Override"
 cstorms.1280.desc: "Unfortunately, our previous estimation appears to have been optimistic: the manual turned out to be just as incomprehensible as the control system. Half of the pages appeared to be missing and the pictorial instructions make significant semiotic assumptions. The other half of the manual is written in difficult to interpret hieroglyphs.\n\nHowever, the last page displayed a com frequency accompanied by a set of characters translated to 'help desk'. We're attempting this frequency now."

 cstorms.1285.desc: "The manual's com frequency connected us to the help desk mainframe of a commercial entity known as Skygarden.\n\nWith a friendly though neutral tone, the help desk AI informed us that it appreciated our reaching out, and asked if there was anything it could aid us with. Among the listed options were 'answering questions about subscriptions', 'learning about the new line of smart defense systems' and if we wished to know more about the corporation's 'social responsibility initiatives'.\n\nHowever, the subsequent options continued to direct us to entirely unrelated topics. Worse of all, it would often put our [Root.Owner.GetEngineerPlural] on hold only to drop the call. Obviously, the service AI has not survived the passing of time as well as the rest of the habitat.\n\nNevertheless, we will continue trying to find our way through this arcane system."

The help desk itself was an AI program she had inherited from the last record keeper. As far as she knows, the com station had not been used since the bankruptcy of Skygarden many decades ago. When we questioned why she remained working for a bankrupt organization, she simply said it was in her contract.\n\nExplaining our situation, the record keeper dug up an old quick start guide to the habitat. She will transfer digital impressions of the pages to us soon."

 cstorms.1300.desc: "With the new guide in our possession, restarting the habitat required little effort.\n\nAfter the noise of activating machinery slowly died down, we decided to reach out to the record keeper once more to thank her.\n\nShe told us she had recovered some information on this station. Apparently it had been built over five centuries ago as a prototype, but was lost in the astrological chaos following a particularly nasty cosmic storm. The loss of property and development costs was enough to bankrupt Skygarden.\n\nHelping us was the record keeper's first useful task in years.\n\n"Besides," she said.

The subterranean structures that were of interest to us are equally ancient, and relatively intact.\n\nSonar resonance imaging revealed a complex underground structure of storage rooms as well as shelters designed to withstand the forces of nature. The destruction on the planet`s surface is no doubt a result of cosmic storms, which would align with the existence of the sanctuary.\n\nHowever, the amount of debris is making it hard to investigate any further. An archaeological dig site could tell us more."

 cstorms.110.desc: "Approaching the shelter from ground-level revealed a small opening beneath two collapsed towers, through which the faint glow of operational machinery could be seen.\n\nThe opening provides an anchor point for our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] to map out the size of the complex, and possibly find a way to open it up without damaging the delicate structural integrity.\n\nThe ruins that entomb this site have all the hallmarks of cosmic storm damage. Curiously, there are no signs that the city's inhabitants attempted to protect themselves.\n\nIt is as if they endured the violence for as long as possible, only to evacuate in a great hurry. Perhaps the answers lie beneath the ruined ground of [From.Planet.GetName]."
 cstorms.110.a: "Understood."
 cstorms.115.name: "Beneath the Towers"
 cstorms.115.desc: "After clearing many layers of debris and dust, the opening underneath the towers grew large enough for our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] to enter the shelter.\n\nThe sanctuary is simple and utilitarian, with many offshoot rooms, most of them empty. In fact, it seems overly simple. It definitely appears to be a shelter of some kind, but it would not hold up against cosmic storms. The walls are too thin, providing very little support, and the ceilings and floors are not reinforced. It has been saved by nothing less than pure luck. Had it not been for the two towers above and the landslide moving the complex in one fell swoop, this 'storm' shelter would have been eradicated long ago.\n\nThe glow seen from the outside stems from a few malfunctioning alarm systems, and several operational terminals can be spotted deeper into the shelter. This could be a prime opportunity to learn more about the previous owners of this facility, as well as the curious circumstances at play."
 cstorms.120.name: "Timeworn Transcriptions"
 cstorms.120.desc: "The terminals were harder to reach than anticipated, partially obstructed by cave-ins. Some of the rubble was more recent, indicating a critical failure with the shelter now that it has been disturbed. Caution is advised.\n\nUnfortunately, the ancient data processors do not give up their secrets easily. Everything was recorded in a lost language, though the intergalactic communication logs left behind in the interface might be able to help us. By combining this with the abandoned physical media scattered around the shelter, we should be able to complete a basic translation. Additionally, there are still more rooms to investigate, so long the shelter does not collapse."

Initial translations describe unprocessed materials and unfinished electrical components, neither of which are imperative to survival. The list also details quantities of items at this location, and the projected profits they would have generated on something called the Intergalactic Network of Equal Trade, INET for short.\n\nThe language surrounding this vast trading exchange is almost ecstatic, with meticulous notes on transactions and itemized indexes of profit. In fact, it appears this vanished civilization based their name on the exchange, calling themselves the Inetian Traders.\n\nThis shelter was not built to protect the general population, but rather as a glorified commodities warehouse. This raises the question as to why their shelters were so woefully under-equipped to handle the storms?\n\nFurther translation should provide more insights, but we are on borrowed time, as evidenced by the unsettling sound of creaking infrastructure."

While the stockpiled merchandise proved fruitless as a source of inquiry, the functioning terminals revealed much.\n\nA set of scrambled coordinates point to the location of a device of 'great power' located on a nearby planet. From what we can understand, this device possessed the ability to "manipulate" a cosmic storm, a claim which would be incredible if true.\n\nHowever, with the waning stability of the shelter and a copy of the coordinates already transmitted to our vessel in orbit, we evacuated the site. Many questions remain unanswered, but the hunt is on."

The thorough destruction will make it difficult to find anything useful, but hopefully not impossible.\n\nOur [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have determined three points of interest near the landing site: a relatively intact public service structure, a temple of some kind, and a massive central square. These should provide a good place to continue digging into the Inetian Traders' secrets. "
 cstorms.145.name: "Economic Epicenter"
 cstorms.145.desc: "Multiple teams fanned out to investigate the three most promising locations. While the service structure and public square were interesting as cultural and architectural examples, only the place of reverence was particularly noteworthy.\n\nIts crumbling facade conceals a cavernous hall. Within, 521 computation terminals are arranged in concentric circles, at the exact center of which rests an impressive - and fully functional - model of this star system. Sensitive nano components within the model are attuned to the planet's electromagnetic fields. Despite its incredible age, the model remains an accurate representation of this system's celestial objects.\n\nFurthermore, along its circular base runs an interface visible from every terminal position. Burned into the picture elements of this interface is a list of corporate entities and stock values. This is not a place of religious reverence, but rather an INET trading hub and stock exchange.\n\nIt is logical to conclude that this building once housed important data. It ought to be found."

With the rudimentary translation keys developed during our excavation on [wm_storm_shelter_planet.GetName], a rough interpretation of these manuals has been made.\n\nThere are instructions for operating the terminals, for tuning the system model, and for calling in assistance from a machine dubbed the Sectoral Disturbance Depressor. The details on how to operate, aim, and activate this machine are explicit.\n\nThis must be the device mentioned in the ancient storm shelter, and may be exactly what we are looking for."

This conclusion is backed by the high standard of living and plentiful luxury facilities still left on the planet; with a small degree of variance, every citizen enjoyed an equal share of comfort and opportunity, no matter their profession, social standing, or lineage.\n\nOn [wm_digsite_B.GetName], we found indexes detailing the use case of each factory. These were all part of much larger production chains, set up to provide the vast empire with the necessary means to support its opulent lifestyle. Equal distribution of these benefits necessitated a truly staggering amount of material and food consumption, produced at breakneck speeds.\n\n[wm_digsite_C.GetName]'s repaired Sectoral Disturbance Depressors provided some more insights before being fully decommissioned.

Though difficult, we were able to clone its pattern and search the galaxy for a match. The trail led to an uninhabited planet. It is time to discover what the Inetian Traders were targeting, and why."

Nor is there any indication of where exactly the signal is coming from. There is no visible transmitter or piece of technology strong enough to have its call registered from systems away.\n\nWe continue our search."
 cstorms.182.name: "Concentrated Catastrophe"
 cstorms.182.desc: "After arriving on the surface, we soon discovered that the signal became stronger or weaker depending on our position. Following this simple pattern, we were led at last to a towering mountain range on the far side of the planet.\n\nAs we approached the looming mountains, the landscape grew ever more blasted, barren, ruined, as if a devastating force had ripped across this part of the world. Based on the damage pattern, we believe this place was at some point ravaged by a cosmic dust storm. However, if that were true, it would be logical to conclude the whole planet would be affected. Never before have we seen such concentrated destruction from such a tempest. To learn more, it will be necessary to scale the imposing peaks."
 cstorms.183.name: "Fleeting Energy"
 cstorms.183.desc: "The ravaged mountain range consisted of many peaks and valleys, but one oddly shaped crater caught our attention very early on. The walls of the pit were smooth, and in its center a number of concentric rings were carved into the ground.\n\nAs we descended into the bowl, we began to feel the pull of a deeply compelling force, inescapable and unmistakably coming from the circle's origin point. Strands of flickering energy arose from the rings, some drifting so far off they eventually escaped the planet's atmosphere. This is the source of the signal.\n\nOur [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] suggest analyzing the crater and its energy fluctuations in order to better understand what happened here."
 cstorms.184.name: "Uncertain Beginnings"
 cstorms.184.desc: "Based on environmental data and detailed simulations, we can safely conclude that it was indeed a celestial dust storm which moved through these peaks. In fact, it formed in this very spot! As for why it did not swallow the entire planet in the process, our best guess is that it was simply too small - analysis describes a storm that was a fraction of the size of even an average tempest.\n\nBased on the fact that the Inetian Traders referred the Sectoral Disturbance Depressors as 'a manipulation device', and that this specific storm's energy signal was stored within their databanks, it seems likely that they were attempting to control the cosmic storm. By calculating the path it took after leaving this place, we may learn much to our advantage."

 cstorms.186.name: "Tracing the Traders"
 cstorms.186.desc: "To track the celestial dust storm's path turned out to be less straightforward than anticipated. Only a few systems away from its origin point something drastic happened to its strength, size, and course. Our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] suspect that it was at this point that the storm was hit with the Sectoral Disturbance Depressors. It knocked the storm off balance, and polluted its inner vortex with the pulverized remains of wildlife swept up from [wm_digsite_C.GetName]'s surface.\n\nAs the storm continued to drift across the galaxy, it engulfed multiple systems with devastating repercussions.\n\nAll of this to alter the course of a minor disturbance away from a particular system... Sensors have detected the presence of an abandoned space station in that system. In order to protect this place, the Inetian Traders left multiple mass extinctions in their wake.\n\nThe station may not be the capital world we hoped for, but it must be equally important to warrant such measures."

It appears to be more than just a station, boasting research instruments as well as sophisticated life support systems and extensive deep space sensors. This may indicate the facility was used more as a long-term colony, rather than a minor waypoint.\n\nIt is in a dismal state, however. The hull has been compromised, with catastrophic decompression having blown out entire sectors. It is unclear whether the damage was caused from the outside, or from within. Fortunately, orbit control and axis stabilization are still operational, explaining why the structure has not drifted into the star or broken out in an unstoppable spin.\n\nGetting inside without destabilizing this fastidiously maintained balance will be difficult."

Eventually we were able to open the door safely. Unfortunately, we were immediately met with another obstacle: a blocked corridor, clogged with twisted support beams and rubble from nearby depressurization. It will take some time before we can proceed."

Personal effects belonging to Inetian Trader citizens were found, as well as logs describing station life. They spoke of an important payload, kept in a tightly guarded chamber somewhere within the base. While it did not take long to locate, the room was revealed to be a tomb.\n\nDesiccated, near-mummified remains occupied the space, each of them members of the Inetian Traders' empire. Given their mundane positions, it seems they did not put up a fight, but simply sat down to die. What happened here?"

Translation came quickly:\n\n§LDearest Visitor, if you are reading this then you are witness to our hubris. In our noble pursuit of equality, we forgot the true equalizer: creation, and destruction.\n\nSeeking to free our trade routes from the ravages of cosmic tempests, we tampered with nature. What were once minor disturbances grew beyond influence. The cosmic storms tore through our worlds. This was not coincidence, but revenge. We sealed ourselves within this station. It was our last defense, as we were too late. Despite no longer using our depressors, new storms were forming, stronger and more savage. Our final mission was clear.\n\nFeverishly we worked to complete this machine, and it was built for you, Visitor. It will save you from the cosmic storms, without further angering them. Our demise is our absolution, it does not have to be yours.§!\n\nWithin this room the Inetian Traders sealed their fate. Their generosity was as grand as their carelessness.

The habitat was built to house entire apartment complexes, shopping centers and schools, but also pleasure gardens, parks and other facilities. This was a place designed for luxury living.\n\nNow however it is entirely abandoned. Not a single organic lifeform was detected within the entirety of the habitat. And we continued to explore, we were struck by the emptiness of this place and the bleak staleness of the atmosphere.\n\nThe artificial sunlight experienced occasional glitches, covering the station in darkness, and while other electronic devices are remain largely operational, they too are affected by these same interruptions.
