 # Crystals
 first_contact_critters.30.name:0 "Living Crystals?"
 first_contact_critters.30.desc:0 "The irregularity we had designated as §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§! appears to be made of some sort of crystalline material. Curiously, it seems to be able to propel itself across the void and protect itself when necessary, indicating that it may be alive. Our [This.Owner.GetResearchers] are working hard to find out more."

 # Drones
 first_contact_critters.40.name:0 "Space Automata"
 first_contact_critters.40.desc:0 "We have discovered a new lifeform in [This.System.GetName], although calling it a "lifeform" may be incorrect. The entities appear to be fully automated, mechanical drones built exclusively for some unknown industrial purpose.\n\nObservations will continue, but since it's likely that these machines are programmed with defensive protocols, it would be prudent to tread lightly."
 first_contact_critters.40.A:0 "Keep looking, but use caution."
 first_contact_critters.45.name:0 "$story.301.name$"
 first_contact_critters.45.desc:0 "Reports of the deep-space drones previously encountered have been investigated closer. The drones appear to be the workers and custodians of an autonomous orbital mining operation, established millennia ago and then soon abandoned by all but the drones themselves, judging by the state of the processing equipment.\n\nThe drones possess powerful mining lasers and make obviously threatening, if not outright hostile, overtures toward [Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] vessels when approached. They may only be old drones, but they should be kept under close watch by the [Owner.GetName]."
 first_contact_critters.45.A:0 "Understood."
 # Marauders
 first_contact_critters.50.name:0 "Signs of Barbarism"
 first_contact_critters.50.desc:0 "Although their dwellings on habitat stations would suggest an advanced society, [This.Owner.GetEnvoy] [This.Leader.GetName] is unsure whether we are indeed dealing with an intelligent lifeform: they seem unremittingly hostile, so much so that a stable society seems almost unthinkable: even during our brief period of investigation, we have observed several displays of pure barbarism.\n\nThey seem to have a language, but our [This.Owner.GetLinguists] are still working on deciphering it so we can make sense of this display."
 first_contact_critters.50.A:0 "Disturbing. We must be watchful."
 first_contact_critters.60.name:0 "Hostile Vessels"
 first_contact_critters.60.desc:0 "The vessels we encountered in the [This.System.GetName] system appear to be somewhat outmoded, but nevertheless armed to the teeth. They seem to be piloted by sentient crews but respond with hostility to any approach. We will have to treat them with caution."
 first_contact_critters.65.desc:0 "Although we have been unable to establish communications with them - mainly because they are unwilling to communicate with us - we have been able to identify the §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§! as pirates. Visual indicators point to their culture being largely spaceborne, and some phenotypes observed among them match no known planet-dwelling civilizations.\n\nUnfortunately, their crews are completely uninterested in civil discourse. What little we have been able to glean from intercepting intra-fleet communications indicate that they primarily subsist on piracy, occasionally recruiting fringe elements of spacefaring civilizations to their cause."
 first_contact_critters.70.name:0 "Unknown Vessels"
 first_contact_critters.70.desc:0 "The vessels detected in the [This.System.GetName] system seem to be part of some sort of expedition across the galaxy, with purposes unknown. They have not made any hostile moves, nor is there any heavy weaponry in evidence - instead, they seem to be broadcasting repetitive but not particularly content-filled signals in our general direction. Our [This.Owner.GetEnvoy], [This.Leader.GetName], is confused, but hopes that the broadcasts will help our [This.Owner.GetLinguists] translate their language."
 first_contact_critters.70.desc.home:0 "The [This.System.GetName] system appears to be home to an advanced society of unknown origins. Dwelling in a series of space stations across the system, [This.Owner.GetEnvoy] [This.Leader.GetName] has observed multiple crafts flitting between them, as well as several larger expeditions leaving the system for unknown purposes. They seem to be broadcasting repetitive but not particularly content-filled signals in our general direction, a development which has confused our [This.Owner.GetLinguists], but may help them to translate their language."
 first_contact_critters.70.A:0 "Curious."
 first_contact_critters.70.B:0 "Troubling."
 first_contact_critters.70.C:0 "The actions of those outside the hive are indeed strange."

 first_contact_critters.75.name:0 "The Caravaneers"
 first_contact_critters.75.desc:0 "We have managed to decipher the confusing, repetitive messages the §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§! were sending us, and it turns out that they were... commercial advertisements! Apparently they call themselves §H[This.ContactCountry.GetRealName]§! and are part of a group of spacefaring traders that make a living by offering the best deals - or what they claim to be the best deals - to whichever civilization they happen to be visiting at the time. True to form, it appears they are attempting to contact us."

 first_contact_critters.80.name:0 "Living Space Debris?"
 first_contact_critters.80.desc:1 "[This.Owner.GetEnvoyCap] [This.Leader.GetName] is still working to confirm the hypothesis that the irregularity we had designated as §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§! is in fact a living organism. While it seems to be made up of a cluster of random star dust, it is demonstrably able to propel itself across the void and shows basic signs of independent agency. Our [This.Owner.GetResearchers] are perplexed by the phenomenon, and are working hard to verify our readings."

 first_contact_critters.90.desc:0 "The vessels detected in the [This.System.GetName] system seem to be part of some sort of expedition across the galaxy, with purposes unknown. They have not made any hostile moves, nor is there any heavy weaponry in evidence. However, they have been fairly closed-mouthed, and we have been unable to pick up many signals from them. Our [This.Owner.GetLinguists] are confident that they will be able to translate their language eventually from the scraps we pick up. However, this may take quite some time."
 first_contact_critters.95.name:0 "The Nomads"
 first_contact_critters.95.desc:0 "We have managed to decipher the language of the mysterious §H[This.ContactCountry.GetName]§!. Our [This.Owner.GetLinguists] remained stumped for quite some time, and a breakthrough was only made once they began broadcasting what turns out to be a welcome message identifying them as the §H"Namarians"§! in our general direction. It appears that they are now eager to talk to us."
 first_contact_critters.100.desc:0 "The fleet we encountered in the [This.System.GetName] system is unlike any we've seen in this region of space before. It does not appear to be aggressive, but we can only speculate as to its origin or purpose here. Our best guess is that the fleet represents a faction without formal ties to any local authority or civilization."
 first_contact_critters.100.a:0 "Proceed with caution."
 first_contact_critters.105.name:0 "Neutral Fleet"
 first_contact_critters.105.desc:0 "We have reached an impasse with the fleet identifying itself as the §H[This.ContactCountry.GetRealName]§!. This unusual presence ignored most of our diplomatic overtures, but we can infer that it represents a neutral entity which stands apart from galactic civilization.\n\nWe suspect that if the fleet possess any owners in the conventional sense, it would take extraordinary measures to reach them. With this in mind, we have summarized our findings for future teams of [this.owner.GetScientistPlural] to make use of - in case such an opportunity does arise." # though we use a country tag here, the value it returns could be e.g. 'Unscrupulous Salvagers' OR 'Modified Probe', i.e. not a true country
