When our leaders protested, the outsiders turned violent. We fought back.\n\nWe won, though barely, and only after suffering sizeable losses. Now, our scientists have finally reverse-engineered the secrets of FTL travel from the ships we destroyed. It's a big galaxy out there, but sooner or later we're sure to meet our 'benefactors' again.

 fircon.5000.name:0 "Missing Orbitals"
 fircon.5000.desc.base:0 "§Y[From.GetName]§! is missing planets.\n\nAll calculations point to the existence of several more celestial bodies, yet they are nowhere to be found in the system. Sensors have been recalibrated and numbers rechecked, but the theory stands disproven by reality. We have marked the missing planetoids positions on our star charts."
 fircon.5000.desc:0 "$fircon.5000.desc.base$\n\nPerhaps a closer scan of the system could reveal more."

 fircon.5005.desc.open:0 "$fircon.5000.desc.base$\n\nWe gather that the neighboring [owner.GetPreFTLLowerPlural] in the Dacha system are connected to this."
 fircon.5005.desc.closed:0 "$fircon.5000.desc.base$\n\nIt seems like the previously neighboring [owner.GetPreFTLLowerPlural] in the Dacha system created this strange system. Yet the hyperlane leading there has since disappeared."

 fircon.5010.name:0 "Grand Theft Planet"
 fircon.5010.desc:0 "The planets were moved!\n\nThe abnormal hyperlanes we detected in the §Y[from.solar_system.GetName]§! system were each tethered to where we previously had expected to discover worlds. After studying these strange lanes, we realize they all lead to the same place. A star system called §YDacha§!, which was thought unreachable, yet if we were to combine all these slender hyperlanes, we could pass a science ship through."
 fircon.5010.a:0 "Find out where the hyperlanes lead!"
 fircon.5010.b:0 "Do we really want to know?"

 fircon.5015.name:0 "Worlds of Plenty"
 fircon.5015.desc:0 "Orbiting each of the three stars in the §Y[From.GetName]§! system are ecological paradises, Gaia worlds, each capable of sustaining organic life. Initially, we thought these might be uninhabited, given the lack of pollution. Yet after performing deeper scans we discovered large sprawling cities spanning each planet from end to end.\n\nStranger still, it seems like only the central star has planets originally from this system. The others are orbited by planets from $NAME_Helito$ and other, more remote systems."
 fircon.5015.a:0 "But... How!?"
 fircon.5015.b:0 "It's beautiful!"

 fircon.5020.name:0 "Habinte Unified Worlds Encountered"
 fircon.5020.desc:0 "Surveying a new Gaia world is usually a momentous event but for the crew of the [Root.GetName] it is going to become routine for the next few months. The multiple worlds house some very strange [Owner.GetPreFTLLowerPlural], they obviously have not achieved spaceflight yet their renewable energy production rivals our most efficient reactors.\n\nA further oddity is the equal spread of resources. Every world has everything they need to survive, which should be impossible. We are seeing goods only produced on one planet arrive on another without a single transport ship taking flight."
 fircon.5020.a:0 "We need an observation outpost now!"

 fircon.5026.name:0 "Bridge Between Worlds"
 fircon.5026.desc:0 "The [GetPreFTLLowerPlural] of §Y[From.solar_system.GetName]§! are somehow more adept with hyperlane theory than we are. Every one of their worlds are linked to each other through an artificial hyperlane network. These lanes are used transport necessary resources like food or building materials to their other worlds just using planet-bound trains, and we have no idea how they did it.\n\nA request for more [Root.GetScientistPlural] to study these worlds has been approved. Though judging by the activity at their planetary listening posts; we are not the only ones looking at aliens."

 fircon.5050.name:0 "Polite Request"
 fircon.5050.desc:0 "The insights we have gained into hyperlane technology through our cooperation with the [event_target:solarpunk_country.GetSpeciesAdj] has been frustratingly slow. It seems that to achieve the mastery of a local hyperlane cluster like they have, we would need to spend thousands of years cataloging hyper-fluctuations. We have received a new communication from their chief representative.\n\n"To be honest, your presence here has been grating, so now that we have taught you what you came for, we need to ask you to leave. Having judged that our ways of life are incompatible, we worry that you might covet what we have in the future. So to prevent any feelings of ill will, we wish to offer you one of our worlds. We will handle the transportation, don't worry.""
 fircon.5050.a:0 "We accept, have a good life."
