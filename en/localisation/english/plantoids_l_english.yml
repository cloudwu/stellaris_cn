 START_SCREEN_FRUITFUL_PLANTOID: "If your roots run deep, yet your spirit grows restless, let others carry your aches away. Let animals sniff your flowers, nourish themselves on your fruits, and bathe in the shadow of your leaves. Let them carry pollen and seeds to distant lands, so that your offspring can bury their roots on foreign soil. And when the wind brings you the sound of rustling leaves, you'll know your children have found a new home.\n\nSince time immemorial, we have worked with local fauna to spread our species across [GetHomeWorldName]. So when the time came to uproot ourselves, branches reaching further skyward, it was only natural we would also connect with the fauna of the void. They chew our fruits. They graze our leaves. And they'll carry our children to distant worlds, where they will bloom and be nurtured by alien suns.\n\nLet our seeds spread. Let the galaxy be our garden."
 START_SCREEN_FRUITFUL_FUNGOID: "If your mycelium run deep, yet your spirit grows restless, let others carry your aches away. Let animals sniff your spores, nourish themselves on your stalks, and bathe in the shadow of your mushroom caps. Let them carry spores to distant lands, so that your offspring can bury their roots on foreign soil. And when the earths brings you the thrums of a new mycorrhizal network, you'll know your children have found a new home.\n\nSince time immemorial, we have worked with local fauna to spread our species across [GetHomeWorldName]. So when the time came to uproot ourselves, toadstools reaching further skyward, it was only natural we would also connect with the fauna of the void. They chew our fruiting bodies. They graze our gills. And they'll carry our children to distant worlds, where they will bloom and be nurtured by alien suns.\n\nLet our spores spread. Let the galaxy be our mushroom garden."

 origin.7100.desc: "For the galaxy's spaceborne fauna, we built a garden. We filled it with flowers, fruit and sticky seed pods, ready to latch to the skin of these magnificent creatures. But would these void-dwellers appreciate our banquet? As soon as they bit the first apple, our anxiety dissipated.\n\nSince time immemorial, we have offered fruit and shade to the animals on our planet. In return, they carried our seeds. Now, this ancient pact has been replicated at a galactic scale: spaceborne fauna will carry our §YSeed Pods§! with them as they travel. With a little luck, our seeds will fall on a §Hcolonizable planet§! where they will have everything they need to establish a new garden for our people. We need only direct an energy beam to activate them, allowing us to inhabit new planets without having to send a colony ship."
