 anomaly.75.name:0 "Rock Brain"
 anomaly.75.desc:0 "A scan of the particularly massive asteroid [From.GetName] yields fascinating results. The rock's core is shot through with a network of conductive crystals carrying a weak electric charge. The crew on the [Root.GetName] recognize this matrix as a primitive neural lattice and believe the celestial body to be thinking in some capacity, if not fully sapient. They seek permission to excavate the core and transport it to the nearest orbital station for closer study."

 anomaly.75.b:0 "Make do with what you can study from the surface."
 anomaly.75.b.tooltip:1 "Adds the §YRock Brain§! modifier to [From.GetName]:\n£physics  §G+8§!"
 anomaly.80.name:0 "Rock Migraine"
 anomaly.80.desc:1 "The core of [From.From.GetName], once coaxed from beneath the crust of the asteroid, does not respond well to the vacuum of space. The [Root.GetName]'s instruments read a sudden energy spike moments before the rocky lump gently, but decisively, fractures.\n\nLarge chunks of the conductive mineral are salvaged, but whatever spectral charge animated them is now gone."

 anomaly.85.name:0 "Gossiping Planets"
 anomaly.85.desc:0 "Irregular electromagnetic bursts from [From.GetName] and its neighboring planets intrigue the crew of the [Root.GetName]. Further study reveals that the bursts are coded communications, though the contents are fairly banal. The electromagnetic activity suddenly ceases, as if in response to the eavesdropping, but not before the [Root.GetName] has cataloged the self-reported statuses of [From.GetName] and every other planet in the system."

 anomaly.90.a:0 "A triffidian menace."
 anomaly.91.name:0 "Grassy Militia"
 anomaly.91.desc:0 "Careful examination reveals that the violent behavior of the vines and grasses of [From.From.GetName] is no dumb self-defense reflex.\n\nThe plants have a complex internal social order. Depending on geographical region, different phyla assume a number of different tasks, the most important one seemingly being staving off native herbivores and would-be invaders from the skies."

 anomaly.105.name:0 "Old-Timey Tunes"
 anomaly.105.desc:0 "A golden disc strikes the forward viewport of the [Root.GetName] as it is surveying the weak gravitational field of [From.GetName].

 anomaly.110.desc:0 "In an abandoned fortress on the surface of [From.GetName], evidently the stronghold of some long-dead race of primitives, a golden disc rests on a pedestal beneath a thick covering of spore-dust.\n\nFirst designated to be stowed away as an alien artifact of minor, possibly xeno-religious significance, an archival computer soon identifies it as the golden phonograph record originally launched with the Voyager probe."
 anomaly.110.a:0 "Play it back. Now."
 anomaly.115.name:0 "Cell Cells"
 anomaly.115.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is partially hollow. Within its interior spaces sprawls a dense honeycomb structure crafted of some unknown alloy, housing containers of alien genetic material.

 anomaly.120.name:0 "Eddic, Monolithic"
 anomaly.120.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is uninhabited and indeed uninhabitable, but not unvisited. Its surface is littered with tall cenotaphs carved from some mineral not native to the planet; evidently placed here by some artistically-inclined spacefaring race.

 anomaly.125.name:0 "Unsolicited Mapping"
 anomaly.125.desc:0 "Intercepting the distress signal, the [Root.GetName] sends a probe down to the volatile surface of [From.GetName]. It seems an unregistered freighter recently crashed on the planet; whatever it was carrying has been reduced an ashen sludge, but some data from the navigation computer can be recovered and survey data for this system reconstructed."
 anomaly.125.a:0 "Make it so."
 anomaly.130.name:0 "Gravity Crush"
 anomaly.130.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName]'s survey of the asteroid is temporarily halted as a probe is caught by an errant gravitational anomaly.\n\nThe probe manages to transmit some data before it is brutally crushed by the extreme forces - forces that completely dissipate soon after."
 anomaly.130.a:0 "At least no one got hurt."
 anomaly.135.name:0 "Abandoned Amusement Park"
 anomaly.135.desc:0 "The structures on [From.GetName] are not as old as we first believed. It seems to be a playground or amusement park of some sort. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] notes that many of the contraptions are highly complex creations that we can learn much from and that, to the builders' alien eyes, this might have been a cutting-edge sensor array, or even a gigantic art installation.\n\nRegardless, to us [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural], it looks mostly like a place where you would take your young and let them amuse themselves."
 anomaly.140.name:0 "Familiar Shrine"
 anomaly.140.desc:0 "Most of the asteroid has been laser-chiseled, with great precision, into the likeness of a small [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] temple, or large shrine.\n\nA shrine to the Untold, the great destroyer-deity of old [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] faiths.\n\nThe temple has been tumbling through the quiet of space for far longer than we have been capable of space-flight, which is... disturbing, at best.\n\nTerrifying at worst.\n\nNaturally, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] urges us to search for more stellar objects that match the characteristics of this space-temple, and has uploaded a list of likely candidates in nearby systems to the Situation Log."

 anomaly.144.a:0 "I see."
 anomaly.145.name:0 "What Music They Make"
 anomaly.145.desc:0 "The animals of [From.GetName], predator and prey alike, gather together as night falls and...\n\nSing.\n\nThe howls, clicks, chirps, roars and hisses are discordant to say the least, but there is a recognizable melody in there. And not a bad one either, to hear the crew of the [Root.GetName] tell it.\n\nThe non-sapient choir is obviously the work of some alien entity, and we may never know their purpose in altering the fauna of [From.GetName] in this way.\n\nWe may, however, be able to at least start to figure out how they did it."
 anomaly.150.name:0 "Below Zro"
 anomaly.150.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is not only an ice giant, but an ice giant made up of very unusual ices. There are pockets of Zro trapped in the within reach of the upper levels of the planet's atmosphere."
 anomaly.155.name:0 "Illicit Matter"
 anomaly.155.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] finds a disturbing tangle of technology hidden in a deep crater on the asteroid's surface.\n\nEvidently someone has, with rather simple means, managed to stabilize a one-way wormhole, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] quickly asserts that the asteroid is the exit point. The other end opens up somewhere in uncharted space some light-years away from a black hole, and small quantities of dark matter are leaking - being siphoned - through the wormhole.\n\nWhoever set this up seems to have abandoned the operation."
 anomaly.160.name:0 "Purple Rain"
 anomaly.160.desc:0 "Images capturing [From.GetName]'s mesmerizing purple-colored rain, taken by the [Root.GetName]'s surface exploration probes, somehow find their way into the hands of the cultural elite on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName].\n\nWhile the discovery is of no scientific value, the evocative imagery of the colorful precipitation sparks a minor renaissance in the [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] art world, the positive effects of which shall be felt for years to come."
 anomaly.165.name:0 "Old Gods: Shrine to the Benefactress"
 anomaly.165.desc:0 "Deciphering the pictograms in the Benefactress' shrine was a much smoother process than anticipated. All linguists involved describe the language quickly "connecting" or "clicking" in their minds, despite its age and complexity.\n\nHowever, the writings are unlikely to make much sense until they are combined with the other writs associated with the rest of the quadrumvirate godhead."
 anomaly.166.name:0 "Old Gods: Shrine to the Undaunted"
 anomaly.166.desc:1 "After days of activities that can best be termed "fiddling," Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has retrieved the doctrine of the Undaunted, a textile scroll coated with a sturdy plastic polymer."
 anomaly.167.name:0 "Old Gods: Shrine to the Percipient"
 anomaly.167.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has reported back with the [Root.GetName]'s findings at the Percipient's shrine. They recognized early on that a text in some logographic script is inlaid in the walls, heavily distorted by the layers of translucent lacquer.\n\nInitial attempts at unscrambling the text, relying on the raw processing power of the [Root.GetName]'s computers to reconstruct the text from plain images, proved fruitless as it was simply too distorted to place in any known lingual family tree. Next, the crew of the [Root.GetName] attempted bombarding the lacquer with light of varying wavelengths and intensity, but no beneficial reactions were observed. [Root.GetLeaderName] apparently considered physically separating the lacquer from the inlaid text, but realized that the strange glyphs would doubtlessly have been made misshapen to begin with, only to assume their proper shape when viewed correctly through the lens of the lacquer.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] was about to call the mission a failure when, looking up as they irritably paced along the edges of the circular space, they realized that discrete lines of cohesive text were momentarily forming before their eyes, melting away only to be replaced by new lines.\n\nNot long after they had the ceiling, walls and floor imaged in a spiral pattern. Texts from other shrines should help us piece it all together."
 anomaly.168.name:0 "Old Gods: Revelation"
 anomaly.168.desc:0 "The complete doctrine of the gods - for that is what the recovered texts have to be regarded as, dwarfing the fairy-tale scraps upon which the old [Root.GetSpeciesName] religions were founded - is as shockingly revelatory as it is revolutionary.\n\nWith only a little bit of creative interpretation, it is clear that the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] were meant for great things, guided by the strong hand of a religious leader.\n\nOur path is one to godhood, but our past is littered with prophecies unfulfilled and sin born of ignorance. Redemption is ephemeral."
 anomaly.168.a:0 "Suppress the findings."

It is staffed by one [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist, a fairly talented and industrious one if their research on [From.GetName] is anything to go by. There is a problem with regards to their identity however; we have been unable to match them against official state records, and they refuse to identify themselves save for stating that they are "an exile."\n\nThey have expressed an interest in returning to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] and serving the [Root.Owner.GetName] directly, on the condition that the [Root.GetName] immediately depart [From.GetName] and no [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] ships ever return there."

It is little but a temporary shelter erected against the savage elements, allowing surface-level planetary study for a limited time before it wears down and conditions become untenable.\n\nThe outpost on [From.From.GetName] is nearing the end of its lifespan, but the planet's intense chill has yet to critically degrade the impermanent structure. The equipment - functional, cheap, intended to be abandoned - is well-used, and the local databanks are filled with detailed but ultimately mundane accounts of the planet as well as the simple experiments that were carried out in its harsh environment.\n\nCuriously, no closer examination seems to have been made of the mineral outcropping the outpost's foundations rest on; scans by the [Root.GetName] indicate that the geological formation, a mountain mostly buried under ice, may be partially hollow. More alarmingly, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the sole inhabitant of the outpost, the mysterious "exile," has gone missing and is nowhere to be found."

 anomaly.172.desc:0 "There is something unusual about the research outpost on [From.From.GetName]. The structure itself is commonplace enough - a temporary shelter erected against the harsh elements, allowing surface-level planetary study for a limited time before it wears down and conditions become untenable - but it is situated on top of a rocky formation poking through the sea of ice that covers the planet.\n\nThe crew of the [Root.GetName] found an intricate system of caves and narrow passages leading into this mountain, accessible from inside the research outpost.\n\nIn one of the larger cavern-halls, they found the desiccated remains of the outpost's original staff. This contingent of [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] researchers had originally been dispatched elsewhere, but evidently diverted to this uninhabited and hostile planet to set up shop.\n\nOf course, the self-proclaimed "exile" is now nowhere to be found. The [Root.GetName] has launched one of its escape pods, transporting the bodies of the deceased back to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]."

A chemical compound, found in the surface ice layers in several regions of [From.From.GetName], is allegedly, supposedly, closely related to [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] Stellar Salt, an ingredient integral to many traditional [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] dishes and thought extinct on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]. It has long been speculated that [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] Stellar Salt was never native to our homeworld, but was brought to the surface by some meteorite impacts in the distant past. The Science Officer's discovery on [From.GetName] lends some credence to this theory, though [Root.GetLeaderName] leans heavily on properties described in ancient cookbooks pre-dating modern chemistry to prove the saline connection.\n\nWhether the salt, analyzed and synthesized, actually tastes like the [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] Stellar Salt of old is ultimately of little consequence. Just the idea of traditional foods now possessing more historically accurate flavor profiles is bound to stimulate both the [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] economy and palate."

 country.1100.desc:0 "Our first stumbling steps into the void beyond §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! were not motivated solely by curiosity, or a desire to conquer the unknown, or a need to leave our mark on the galaxy.\n\nThe biosphere of §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! has undergone rapid changes in the past few centuries, and prominent scientists warn that §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! may be faced with the beginnings of a mass extinction event; that cyclical purging of life that is inseparable from planetary existence in the greater cosmos.\n\nA research plan has been put together to study a number of planets rendered uninhabitable by major astronomical incidents or planet-bound catastrophes. We hope that by reconstructing these events, a similar fate may be avoided for §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! and the §Y[Root.GetSpeciesName]§! race.\n\nIt falls to you as [Root.GetRulerTitle] of the §Y[Root.GetName]§! to ensure that this expedition is carried out.\n\nConsult the §HSituation Log§! for details."

 country.1105.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Broken Planet"
 country.1105.desc:0 "Our astronomers are confident that the asteroid belt in this system was once a habitable planet, torn asunder by unknown forces.\n\nA Special Project has been issued to study one of the major asteroids in the belt."
 country.1110.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Burned Planet"
 country.1110.desc:0 "One of the planets orbiting this star bears the still-open wounds of some past calamity. Its surface is a roiling sea of half-melted minerals boiling into a superheated atmosphere, but [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] astronomers claim that it may once have supported life.\n\nA Special Project has been issued to study the molten planet."
 country.1115.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Desolate Planet"
 country.1115.desc:0 "A planet in this system still wears the fossilized traces of a past ecology on its sleeve. What could turn a thriving biosphere into a blasted wasteland?\n\nA Special Project has been issued to trace the source of this disastrous transformation."
 country.1120.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Noxious Planet"
 country.1120.desc:0 "Allegedly this planet's flora and fauna choked on their own poisonous emissions, likely helped along by the release of reactive gases from beneath the planet's crust.\n\nA Special Project has been issued to investigate the matter."
 country.1125.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Chilly Planet"
 country.1125.desc:0 "The planet of interest in this system is covered in layer upon layer of dense ices of varying composition. Apparently it was once home to more varied and pleasant biomes.\n\nA Special Project has been issued to investigate this possibility."
 country.1130.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Asteroid"
 country.1130.desc:0 "The asteroid is in actuality a chunk of what was once a habitable, and probably inhabited, planet. Regular but overlapping fracture patterns indicate that the planetary demolition was intentional and controlled, if somewhat rushed.\n\nAll signs point to this planet being the homeworld of whatever species destroyed it. We may never know what drove them to consider planetary annihilation to be the lesser evil, and perhaps we should be grateful for that."
 country.1135.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Molten"
 country.1135.desc:0 "The unfortunate fate of the planet can be laid squarely at the feet of cosmic whims. Some gravitational disturbance (after eying the system's sun with some suspicion, our scientists named a transient space-time anomaly as the likely culprit) forced the planet from its natural orbit to one much too close to the sun. Although the planet is slowly spiraling out towards its original orbit, it has been cooking in the residual heat from the star ever since."
 country.1140.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Barren"
 country.1140.desc:0 "Life on the now-barren planet was, sadly, doomed from the start.\n\nAs if by some cruel stellar conspiracy, the dominant species on the planet barely had time to awaken to sapience and invent agriculture before, through unfortunate geological mechanisms, the earth started turning sour.\n\nSamples from lower soil strata and the fossilized remains of the creatures that once roamed the planet show that several vital minerals needed to rejuvenate the soil ended up, through their largely agricultural diet, in the endoskeletons of the native beings. Their bones were prone to fossilize rather than decay, and their very existence exhausted the fragile ecosystem they inhabited, leaving it permanently transformed in the wake of their passing."
 country.1145.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Toxic"
 country.1145.desc:0 "The cracks in the planet's crust, first presumed to be the result of significant tectonic activity, are actually the lasting marks of impossibly large roots, burrowing through the earth.\n\nAt some point in the distant past, a freak mutation - possibly deliberately induced by sapient beings, though it is unlikely they could have predicted the result - caused the native plant life to grow out of control. Many of these plants reproduce through pollination, with countless gametes carried by currents through the lower atmosphere. While this process was originally only cause for mild irritation, the exponential increase in atmosphere-borne particles effectively choked the life out of all animals on the planet in a matter of months."
 country.1150.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Frozen"
 country.1150.desc:0 "An unnatural shift in the atmosphere's chemical make-up resulted in the slow but irreversible onset of an ice age - one that began before the formation of the [Root.Owner.GetName] and is likely to persist long after our passing.\n\nThe exact cause remains unknown, but probable explanations include failed terraforming attempts or even intra-planetary terrorism. Some of the more radical elements within the scientific community on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] suggest that the dramatic climate shift may have been brought on by the unchecked emission of gaseous industrial by-product into the atmosphere.\n\nThis view is confined to the scientific fringe, as it is unlikely that any race intelligent enough to achieve full industrialization would be stupid enough to accidentally wipe themselves out."
 country.1155.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Study Complete"
 country.1155.desc:0 "While the research expedition often yielded unexpected results, [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] scientists now have access to an unprecedented wealth of data with which to accurately model the future of [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nInitial reports suggest that [Root.Capital.GetName] will be in no real danger for at least a dozen generations, save from freak cosmic events or the violent collapse of the [Root.GetName]."

 country.1157.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Future Faith"
 country.1157.desc:0 "The populace has been growing increasingly restless as news of the study slowly filtered down through the media. Now, we have the chance to dispel all their doubts and fears in one fell swoop."
 country.1157.a:0 "The homeworld is safe."
 country.1157.b:0 "Another successful operation by the [Root.GetRulerTitle]."
 country.1158.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Information Dissemination"
 country.1158.desc:0 "The information gleaned by the research expedition is the property of the [Root.GetName] and access to it is restricted; a precaution put in place early on to prevent premature and unfavorable conclusions.\n\nWith the study now complete, there is a strong lobby for releasing all associated data to the wider scientific community."

Once their task is complete they return to a pocket in the host Amoeba to receive new orders. This allows them to work as manipulators, hands severed from the body. The obvious drawbacks in this inherently delayed reaction time are somewhat offset by the Amoeba's sheer number of circulating flagella, and the individual flagellum's strong set of reflexive responses and ability to dumbly track the host Amoeba.

A number of them woke and entered the atmosphere of [Root.GetName], as is their wont, only to slam into the surface of the planet at full thrust.\n\nRepeatedly, in many cases.\n\nDamage to the colony was negligible but the nigh-invulnerable drones were destroyed in bright showers of blue sparks, indicative of the tremendous force of, and dedication to, their self-destruction."

Once this fact was established, one thing stood out - the parts that were identical. Separated from the rest, it is clear these parts are of somewhat modern, if alien, make. It is likely that someone has done what we could not, and tampered with the drones."

We have learned that they are unwitting pawns in an elaborate scheme set up by an unknown faction.\n\nGoing by the modus operandi of this operation, this faction is most likely a particularly old and particularly clever pirate syndicate. They must have found the drones drifting through space and done what we could not; modified them. While not as impressive as it sounds - all they did was introduce self-contained alien technology into the drones - fact remains that these alien pirates possess a technological know-how far in advance of our own, at least in certain areas. Having installed their comms devices in the drones, the pirates let them drift through space again, knowing that they are set to assist their original masters' colonists and that the drones' ability to accurately identify such colonists has degraded with age. The drones have essentially been fattening up our colony as the pirates watch, waiting for the ideal time to strike.\n\nOur military analysts predict that the pirates will strike within the next two years."

The whole genus that Mharin Kharin belonged to burned in the fire of its own unnaturally rapid proliferation. The soil is starved of the specific nutrients the pollinating plants need - once the currently living specimens die, which will be soon, it will be a long time before that flora can again establish a foothold in the ecosystem, if it ever will.\n\nThe inhabitants of [Root.GetName] are dead, and the planet's atmosphere is temporarily noxious with plant emissions."
