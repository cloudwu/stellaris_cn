It is a repeating, half-coherent message in the [Root.Owner.GetAdj] language - something like a poem. It repeats the phrases §HGRAVITY IS DESIRE§! and §HTIME IS SIGHT§!. It encodes co-ordinates near the black hole. And it ends with a dedication §Gby name§! to the Science Officer - who adds dispassionately that they have confirmed that the signal has been radiating into interstellar space since before their birth.

Then the transmission becomes distorted. What happens next is analyzed exhaustively.\n\nThe excitement in Science Officer [horizonsignal_firstleader.GetName]'s voice tautens to fear as the ship's hull struggles under increasingly exotic conditions. The ship triggers a distress call. [horizonsignal_firstleader.GetName] cries out "the worm!" - or, perhaps, §Hthe Worm§!! Then all transmissions end. No trace of the [Root.GetName] is ever found - no further transmissions, no debris, and the space at those co-ordinates is innocuous and utterly free of distortions. But the data they sent back has advanced our Physics research dramatically. Perhaps it was worth their lives."

Dating techniques suggest it's a pre-industrial relic, hand-hewn from volcanic rock. However, the recurring symbol on the walls and radial altar - a Möbius-looped serpent consuming its own tail - has no obvious precedent in our early history, and the inscriptions use an unknown alphabet. One excitable archaeologist suggests it's a relic left by an unknown precursor race.\n\nIn a presumably meaningless coincidence, the quake seems to have occurred at the same time as the final message from the black hole in [horizonsignal_system.GetName]."

If the builders found particular dates important, we'll never know which ones. We've had better luck with the "unknown alphabet." It's a debased variant of a better-known hieratic script - not an alien language at all - and we've successfully deciphered it. The temple is dedicated to the "Waiting Worm" or the §HWorm-in-Waiting§!. Most of the inscriptions are sonorous, poetic invocations requesting its appearance or, if read in the other direction, its departure. There is also a body of inscriptions describing the "operations of the universe," which our more excitable archaeologist swears contains references to advanced field equations - nothing new to us, but very impressive for a temple of this vintage. We have yet to find a physicist who's prepared to go on record as agreeing that the references are meaningful, though.\n\nThe temple holds no cosmic secrets or alien weapons, as far as we can tell. But its dark spaces have a distinctive, menacing beauty, and the poetry of the invocations to the Worm-in-Waiting becomes fashionable.

 akx.10020.desc:0 "The Worm loves us. It will always love us, and thus it always has. It winds around the hot heart of our home star. It winds around every infinitesimal loop of genetic information. It provokes a shuddering series of cataclysms in the planetary crust of our home, but when our star grows cold, that cataclysm will warm us. We understand so much more. We will always be what we were going to be, wound tight in the love of the Worm."

 akx.10021.desc:0 "The Worm came in through the boundary fences of spacetime like a hungry predator, or a jilted and furious lover. It's still out there, and wherever it is, no doubt it's angry. But you have the incandescent shards of its avatar to hoard and to study, as a cosmic trophy. Other empires will know what you have achieved today."
 akx.10021.a:0 "There are none like us! And perhaps there never will be."
