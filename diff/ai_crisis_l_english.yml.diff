OLD crisis.2042.desc:0 "We have wrested control over §H[From.From.GetName]§! from the warforms of the Contingency, and the fighting has finally settled down. There are no survivors from the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s original population at the time of the Contingency's initial invasion, and our forces made short work of the roving Custodian Bots that had taken their place in the deserted cities.\n\nDo we want to settle this world, or should we leave it behind?"
CN  crisis.2042.desc:1 "我们从作战体手中夺取了§H[From.From.GetName]§!，与紧急预案的战争告一段落。自从紧急预案入侵了[From.From.GetPlanetMoon]后，当地的原住民都无一幸存，我们的安置机器人已经简单的清理了他们废弃的城市。\n\n我们是否要殖民这个星球，还是留到以后再说？"
