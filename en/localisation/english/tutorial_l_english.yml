 TUTORIAL_EMPIREVIEW_PLANETS_DESC:5 "The §SPlanets and Sectors§! screen provides an overview of all our colonized worlds, their §SPops§!, and their §SResource Output§!. As our empire grows it can be organized into Sectors, which are helpful for administering larger empires.\n\n§SSectors§! can be automated here, and if they are automated they can be given a specialization and resources to enable planets within them to build and upgrade §SBuildings§! and §SDistricts§! on their planets."
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_FLEET_TITLE:0 "Military Fleets"
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_FLEET_DESC:2 "§SMilitary Fleets§! are used to protect our emerging empire from threats... or to expand our glorious rule through force of arms, if we so wish.\n\nOur current §SNaval Capacity§! is limited, but it can be increased by researching new technologies, owning additional §SPops§! and building §SStarbase Anchorages§!.\n\nWe can assign one of our §SAdmirals§! to command a Fleet, granting extra military power along with any other bonuses the leader provides."
 TUTORIAL_SCIENCE_SHIP_TITLE:0 "Science Ships"
 TUTORIAL_SCIENCE_SHIP_DESC:3 "This is our §SScience Ship§!, which is used to §SSurvey§! astronomical objects such as planets in a star system. A planet needs to be surveyed in order to make its §SResources§! visible.\n\nOur home system has already been surveyed, so we should focus our efforts elsewhere. With the Science Ship selected, open the §SGalaxy Map§!, right click on a star neighboring our home system and select §SSurvey System§!. The ship will now travel to this system and survey all of its planetary bodies."
 TUTORIAL_CONSTRUCTION_SHIP_TITLE:0 "Construction Ships"

 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_TILES_DESC:2 "Here we see a breakdown of this planet's population, divided into layers, or §SStrata§!.\n\nThey can be expanded to view the §SJob§! types within each §SStratum§!. §SJobs§! use and produce different resources, and the Pop working a Job needs a certain amount of §SHousing§! and §SAmenities§!. A lack of either will reduce §SHappiness§!, which can lower the planet's §SStability§!."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_COMBAT_TITLE:0 "Army View"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_COMBAT_DESC:4 "This is where we manage all ground forces on this planet. This screen also tracks how much §SDevastation§!, or damage, the planet itself has suffered.\n\nNew §SArmies§! are also raised here, by clicking the §SRecruit§! button in the center. §SDefense Armies§! are produced automatically by §SPops§! working Enforcer or Soldier §SJobs§!.

 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_SPACEPORT_TITLE:0 "Spaceport"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_SPACEPORT_DESC:3 "The §SSpaceport§! tab is where we view orbiting fleets and build new civilian ships. Military ships can only be constructed at a §SStarbase§! equipped with a §SShipyard§!, but Construction, Science and Colony Ships are all built here.\n\nEven if we lose our last Starbase, we still have the means to expand and rebuild as long as we possess at least one inhabited planet."
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_STATION_TITLE:0 "Military Stations"
 TUTORIAL_MILITARY_STATION_DESC:2 "§SMilitary Stations§! are static defenses that can be used to protect important planets or strategic avenues of approach, but can only be built within our borders or territories we have special access to.\n\nTake care not to build too many - like ships, their upkeep costs will be a drain on our economy."
 TUTORIAL_RESEARCH_STATION_TITLE:0 "Research Stations"
 TUTORIAL_RESEARCH_STATION_DESC:1 "A §SResearch Station§! built in orbit of a planetary body will gather its §SPhysics§!, §SEngineering§! and §SSociety§! research data.\n\nThey can only be built within our borders, and they are not needed if the planet has already been colonized."

We can also see the current §HIntel level§!.\n\nYour §SRelations§! with the selected Empire are shown as one of five levels, ranging from 'Terrible' to 'Excellent'. In order to make a deal or agreement you must have a sufficient Relations level.\n\nYou can assign §SEnvoys§! to an Empire in order to §SSpy§! on them, gather §SIntel§!, bypass §SRelations§! requirements or §SImprove§! or §SHarm Relations§!."

 TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_VIEW_HIGHINTEL_DESC:0 "We have reached a §Shigh Intel level§! with this Empire, and so have access to a lot more information about them.\n\nMaintaining High Intel with an Empire will ensure we have up-to-date information about their §SEthics§! and §SCivics§!, their §SRelations§! with other Empires, and their §STechnology§!, §SEconomy§! and §SMilitary§! power relative to us."
 TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_VIEW_LOWINTEL_TITLE:0 "Low Intel Level"
 TUTORIAL_DIPLOMACY_VIEW_LOWINTEL_DESC:0 "Our §SIntel level§! with this Empire is dropping. We risk losing the information we have previously gathered about them, as Intel becomes §Sstale§! over time.\n\nIntel level can be increased by maintaining §SDiplomatic agreements§!, sending Envoys to work on §SRelations§!, or maintaining a §SSpy Network§! or §SEmbassy§! in that Empire."
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_ADJACENCY_BONUS_TITLE:2 "Adjacency Effects"
 TUTORIAL_PLANETVIEW_ADJACENCY_BONUS_DESC:2 "Some §SBuildings§! may cause §SAdjacency Effects§! to other §SBuildings§! in neighboring §STiles§!. Let us take this into consideration when constructing new facilities."

 TUTORIAL_EMPIREVIEW_LEADERS_TITLE:0 "Leaders"
 TUTORIAL_EMPIREVIEW_LEADERS_DESC:1 "The §SLeaders§! screen provides an overview of our Leaders and lets us hire, dismiss, and manage them.\n\nA Leader's §SClass§! determines their possible assignments across our empire, and what position on the Council they can undertake.\n\nThe Leaders available for hire will periodically refresh. We should remember to keep an eye out for new prospects.\n\nWe can support only a limited number of Leaders. Going over our capacity will significantly increase the costs of their upkeep, and reduce their gained experience. It is recommended that redundant or idle Leaders be kept to a minimum."
 TUTORIAL_EMPIREVIEW_FACTIONS_TITLE:0 "Factions"
 TUTORIAL_EMPIREVIEW_FACTIONS_DESC:4 "The §SFactions§! screen gives an overview of the populace's political leanings. Be aware that shifts in the sociopolitical climate may give rise to §SFactions§!. Details on §SFaction§! sizes, attractiveness to our Pops, and how content they are may also be found here.\n\n§SFactions§! have §SIssues§! that are important to their overall §SApproval§!, and our policies and actions as a nation may displease or please these groupings, providing an increasing boost to £unity£§YUnity§! generation. The strength of §SFactions§! and the nature of their §SIssues§! can change along with our circumstances, but keep in mind that the §SHappiness§! of a §SPop§! can be affected by the §SApproval§! of the §SFaction§! it belongs to.\n\nWe can also §SManage Factions§! to manipulate the relationship between a §SFaction§! and the state, even going so far as embracing the ethos of a strong §SFaction§!."
