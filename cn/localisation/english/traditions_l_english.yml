 ap_engineered_evolution_desc:0 "将我们的基因交由自然来改良是个低效率且超绝缓慢的流程。为什么不直接飞跃开辟我们物种的未来？"
 ap_evolutionary_mastery_desc:0 "进化是个一根筋的野物，它只遵循一条道路前进，会走向不可避免的结果。我们不能就这样限制自己——让我们同时探索所有道路。"

 ap_the_flesh_is_weak_desc:0 "我们不能接受我们羸弱的有机身体所造成的种种限制和约束。为了发挥充分的潜力，我们必须向赛博族转变。"
 ap_synthetic_evolution_desc:0 "放弃禁锢我们思想的充满缺陷的有机体的时候到了。通过将我们的神经模式转化为合成人的身体，我们将飞升为更高级的存在。"

 ap_mind_over_matter_desc:0 "我们的大脑只有很小一部分潜力得到开发。我们物种的潜在灵能能力现在才开始在一部分的个体中体现出来。"
 ap_transcendence_desc:0 "我们站在唤醒我们物种真正的灵能力量的门槛之上。我们的思想已经准备好了，我们听到了远在我们之上的灵能境界的细语……"
 
 ap_world_shaper_desc:0 "对整个行星进行精心塑造并改变其生态系统，和艺术家从黏土雕刻出雕塑相比并没有太大的不同。"
 ap_master_builders_desc:0 "构建一个巨型工程需要前所未有的大量资源与预先规划。我们正在宏观工程领域开创新局面。"
 ap_imperial_prerogative_desc:0 "随着我们文明不断壮大，它的心跳也必须扩张。我们要将更多的恒星系纳入我们的直接控制中。"
 ap_one_vision_desc:0 "只有当国家与其人民的终极目标相同，才能达成真正的团结。毕竟，一座内部分裂互相对抗的房屋无法长久维持。"
 ap_consecrated_worlds_desc:0 "银河是诸多圣地的所在地，有些比其他的更显著。作为凡人，我们仍然努力去让宇宙中真正的自然变得神圣。"
 ap_galactic_force_projection_desc:0 "舰队是我们帝国的意志显现的凭依——我们或生或死，全仰仗其力量。"
 ap_defender_of_the_galaxy_desc:0 "星际国家在小小的争端中相互争夺的同时，拥有无法想象的力量的邪恶势力正摩拳擦掌准备侵袭所有情感生命——谁会保护我们？"
 ap_galactic_contender_desc:0 "堕落帝国贪恋着他们的衰朽文明的遗产，时而害怕着他们周围的更年轻且更富有活力的种族。他们的时代早已过去了。"
 ap_technological_ascendancy_desc:0 "数代以前与魔法并无区分的技术现在是我们能够企及的了。技术的新时代已然开始。"
 ap_mastery_of_nature_desc:0 "虽然我们很早以前就掌握了我们母星的自然环境，但当遇到外星的生物群落时我们面临新的挑战。它们也应当被克服。"
 ap_voidborn_desc:0 "曾被视为冷漠与不可逾越的屏障的太空，现在已经是我们的第二家园。我们越来越多的年轻人直到成年都没有踏上过行星一步。"
 ap_the_circle_of_life_desc:0 "一个围绕恒星轨道建造、有人造栖息地的巨型环状建筑。理论上，这是可能的……"
 ap_galactic_wonders_desc:0 "巨型工程是我们时代的奇迹。这样的工程的广度在数代以前不可想象。"
 ap_interstellar_dominion_desc:0 "我们在群星之间的地位是实在的，是毋庸置疑的，我们的国界也是一样。"
