 cyber.505.name: "Future Shock"
 cyber.505.desc.gov: "The augmentation of our people has been a triumph of streamlined manufacturing processes and decision-making. Our multitude of distinct voices have been acknowledged with their concerns addressed. Now, every single §Y[root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! has equal opportunity to benefit from these life-altering implants.\n\nThe logical next step is to examine the wider implications of this technology. Are we to leverage it for the democratic process or elevate our workers via experience synchronization?"
 cyber.505.desc.cor: "The augmentation process with our partnered corporations has been successfully completed. Implants have been manufactured, distributed, and installed with staggering efficiency. The many voices of §Y[root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! society have been heard, and their legitimate concerns have been dealt with. We are ready to face the future with renewed vigor.\n\nThe government is now prepared to take its own next step. We can use our technological advances to improve the democratic process or synchronize implants in the service of workers."
 cyber.505.desc.ind: "Despite some apprehension from government officials, the decentralized distribution model of the implants has worked. Small clinics and services are popping up on every street corner allowing anyone to augment themselves without having to travel great distances.\n\nOur government must be ready to move on as well. We can either use the implants to strengthen our democratic process or use them to synchronize our experiences for the benefits of ourselves and the workers."

While the §Y[Species.GetNamePlural]§! are fitted with their government-issued cybernetic implants, and we have a unique opportunity to explore untapped opportunities these chips now afford.\n\nShould we push for a society where fierce competition raises our workers to new heights or harness the idle computational power of the sleeping minds?"

 cyber.515.desc.ind: "General hospitals, corner shops, and hacker communities are now ready to distribute and install cybernetic implants on the populace. But there is no need to decentralize our power over this new and exciting technology so wholly.\n\nWe could provide custom implant modifications, with our own covert surveillance tools hidden within, to be able to keep tabs on problematic individuals.

Or, the empire can elevate the capital and entertain with cybernetically enhanced athletes participating in state-of-the-art bloodsport events."
 cyber.520.desc.ind: "Despite numerous reservations from imperial officials, decentralized distribution and installation of cybernetic implants has been successful. Multiple small clinics across our worlds have been working tirelessly to enhance our population.\n\nThe question now is where the actual value of implants should be focused.

Our analytics team is proposing two potential sources of income, both with their own risks and rewards.\n\nShould the government require the inclusion of advertising in all future ocular implants, or mandate regular upgrades for the augmented population?"
 cyber.525.desc.cor: "Implant production and installation is as efficient as expected from our highly optimized corporate infrastructure. The business opportunities of these new implants are practically endless.\n\nTwo particularly promising avenues present themselves.

 cyber.525.desc.ind: "Unsurprisingly, the haphazard "communal" implementation of cyberware is coming to its merciful end. We now have the opportunity to influence the direction of this promising new technology, raising our product margins in the process.\n\nShould advertisements be included in all future ocular implants, or would it be better to mandate a continuous upgrade cycle for software and wetware?"

Instead of relying on subjective and slow teaching methods, we could transfer key knowledge directly from one brain to another. This requires sterile laboratory conditions, and thus would not be exploitable in large scale. The received information also overwrites parts of the recipient's own memories of a similar kind.\n\nThe most impactful application would involve knowledge sharing between scientists.

These domestic groups have chosen to live in tailor-made isolation, sharing each other's feelings and experiences with unique intimacy.\n\nSome social welfare groups and scholars applaud this phenomenon, suggesting everyone could benefit from custom augmentation of relationships and family bonds. Others have raised concerns about such a retreat from wider society, with some even suggesting the practice may cause individuals to lose themselves in miniaturized 'love gestalts'."

Our plan is ready, but the logistics of our transformation are yet to be finalized.\n\nWe could order all our drones to head to an $building_augmentation_center$ and undergo the procedure, suspending their daily activities. This process would be very fast, but would leave our factories empty until it is complete. Alternatively, we could work around our drones' schedules, turning them into cyborgs during their mandatory resting periods in order to not impact their activities. Although slower, this plan is less disruptive."

 cyber.2320.desc: "Empires composed of singular entities watch us with suspicion, fearing our plurality. With cybernetic implants, we could give our envoys more distinct faces and personalities, presenting a less homogeneous facade.\n\nThe disunited would appreciate the effort. They might even start to... empathize with us. See us as one of them."

 cyber.2360.name: "One Population, Two Groups"
 cyber.2360.desc: "The cyberization of our Hive is continuing smoothly. Part of our population now carries cybernetic implants, while others are still completely biological. Never before have we experienced such striking differences between our selves. Drones are now able to identify themselves as part of one or the other group, and this split is expanding their sense of individuality.\n\nSome drones have started to adorn themselves with small accessories, or are painting symbols on their implants to tell each other apart. It's an intriguing, yet unnerving development."

# CYBERIZATION STAGE 4

 cyber.2420.b: "It's not worth the cost."
 cyber.2420.c: "Recycle the implants... and the bodies."

 cyber.2460.name: "Implants For One Lifetime"
 cyber.2460.desc: "Our existing population is undergoing cyberization at a steady rate, but we must establish a process for those yet to be born.\n\nWith our technology, we can fit our [owner.Species.GetSpawnNamePlural] with cybernetic implants before they are even born, creating a truly cybernetic species: a quick, easy and efficient solution. On the other hand, preliminary research show that installing implant at an early age early could cause dissociation, psychosis, tremors, and assorted developmental disorders."
