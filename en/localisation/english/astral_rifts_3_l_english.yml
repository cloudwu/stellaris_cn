With few options left, they reluctantly accepted these changes to their biology. The pacifistic Baol empire, built on agriculture and ecosystem management, is now populated by a standing militia of highly resilient drones with tremendous physical strength.\n\nNow more prepared for land warfare, the Baol have offered us a defensive node out of gratitude.

This involved managing limited resources while under siege, as well as the design and upkeep of military fortifications. This one maintained steady population levels despite the blockade. This one's work was deemed useful."
 astral_rift.3031.b: "How do you feel about joining us?"
 astral_rift.3031.b.response: "This one did all it could for the Baol. In that role, there was no further room for growth; when a living system fails to grow, it begins to die. In this dimension there is further opportunity for service. There is hope of renewal."
 astral_rift.3031.c: "How does it feel to be separated from the collective?"
 astral_rift.3031.c.response: "Limited. Frustrating... Exhilarating. The sensation is unlike anything this one has ever experienced. However, the sooner this one is integrated into the workings of [Explorer.GetName] the better. It is much more agreeable to work in service of a greater entity."
 astral_rift.3031.d: "How did you choose your name?"
 astral_rift.3031.d.response: "One of your researchers that came through the Astral Rift provided this one with an artificially intelligent text generation program. A query was made based on this one's qualities, and it returned: §Y$NAME_Baol_leader$§!. It feels... suitable."

 astral_rift.3035.name: "Under the Radar"
 astral_rift.3035.desc: "After sharing the secrets the cloaking field with the Baol, they were able to produce an array of organic cloaking satellites. These experimental offshoots are temporary in nature, and require a small amount of astral thread to maintain, but they should last long enough to hide the Baol homeworld from the Grunur. Unfortunately, this colony is already known to the Grunur, and is likely doomed.\n\nOnce cloaked, the Baol will have to sacrifice their space-faring ambitions for the time being, as any ship sighted departing from the homeworld may reveal its location. Of course, this inconvenience is infinitely preferable to annihilation."

 astral_rift.3047.desc: "The Baol colony on the far side of the rift in [From.solar_system.GetName] has been destroyed by the Grunur. We gathered detailed research data from battle, but the target of this observation project has been eliminated."

 astral_rift.3049.name: "Astral Shield"
 astral_rift.3049.desc: "By integrating astral thread into the Baol's defensive technology, we have projected a reactive yet sturdy form of planetary shielding around their besieged colony. The barrier will surround the planet and protect the Baol for as long as it stands.\n\nHopefully, it will survive long enough for the Grunur to move on to more accessible targets."
