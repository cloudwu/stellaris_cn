Deep in a remote mountain range, they stumbled across a mysterious structure that, according to our scans, was not there when we first surveyed the [This.GetPlanetMoon]. Its condition is excellent, almost as if it was newly built, but there is no evidence of [Owner.GetAdj] involvement in its construction. In fact, its architecture shows alien characteristics, with curves and angles that appear unusual and even disturbing to our aesthetic sensibilities.\n\nAt its entrance, there is a sign (in our language, curiously) with the words "Welcome to the Magnificent Labyrinth of Exotic Trans-Dimensional Anomalies.

From one day to the next, it inexplicably shifted its location, and the warning signs at the entrance have disappeared - in fact, it now looks... inviting.\n\nWhile some are curious to enter, our [Owner.GetResearchers] urge caution. What is clear, however, is that we can no longer content ourselves with observing the labyrinth - a new approach will be necessary."

It would seem implausible that it is real snow, given that [Root.GetName] is a desert planet where temperatures are seldom below freezing, even in the polar regions. Besides, there were no sightings of it actually falling from the sky. Nevertheless, initial readings suggest that the substance does indeed consist mainly of frozen water - though quite why it's not melting is unclear.

If it does not stop growing soon, there are growing concerns that the colony will be unable to continue to support itself.\n\nOur [Owner.GetResearchers] on the planet have sought, in vain, to explain the phenomenon. When removed from the main body, the snow quickly melts, leaving behind only some organic matter. Our [Owner.GetResearchers] theorize that this residue is causing the snow to maintain its integrity, sheltering it from heat via an unknown chemical reaction. However, they caution that this is only their best guess, and they have managed to find out very little about the strange compound."
