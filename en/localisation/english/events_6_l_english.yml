 # Events
 anomaly.2080.name:0 "The Enigmatic Robot"
 anomaly.2580.desc:0 "As our scientists were looking into the earlier civilization on [From.GetName], they came across a small enigmatic robot trying to hide from them. Following weeks of approaching and befriending the little thing, it finally brought them back to a still-functional factory that it has been supervising since the demise of its creators.\n\nAfter being guided to the building, our people were given a large quantity of resources they could bring back to their ship. Though weird and hard to communicate with, the little robot seems to think of our scientists as its friends."

 anomaly.6700.name:0 "Narrow Escape"
 anomaly.6700.desc:0 "As the [Root.GetName]s' crew explored the barren wastes of §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§!, the first reports were much as expected: this is an unnatural wasteland with no signs of life above the water's surface. However, the planet's aquatic life has evolved well past the point we would expect some species to make forays onto dry land.\n\nAdditionally, the crew discovered what originally appeared to be various ancient-looking, sand-covered structures. Shortly after they began digging into these apparent buildings, small swarms of nanites emerged and began harassing the researchers. It seems the buildings are formed not from sand, but by billions of microscopic nanomachines!\n\nOnce mobilized, these swarms quickly multiplied, awakening more and more of the dormant whole. [Root.GetLeaderName] ordered a swift evacuation of the planet, allowing the [Root.GetName] just enough time to escape the atmosphere with a swarming storm of nanites in hot pursuit. The remaining swarm now seems agitated, and it's not calming down."
 anomaly.6700.a:0 "Figure out what happened here."

 anomaly.6705.name:0 "On the Origin of Nanites"
 anomaly.6705.desc.start:0 "The [root.GetName] has completed its study of the nanites native to §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§!, and the results are incredible. Thousands of years ago, a ship hailing from an advanced civilization crashed here. Aboard that vessel were robots of dozens different designs."
 anomaly.6705.desc.L:0 "Curiously, it seems these machines might have been a tool of the mysterious Gate Builders, though older than any L-Gate we have found."
 anomaly.6705.desc.noL:0 "Whoever built these machines was in possession of truly advanced technology, long before our time."
 anomaly.6705.desc.end:0 "\nThe robots operated autonomously and attempted to secure the planet according to their programming. However, without their creators to rein them in, a battle soon broke out amongst the machines.\n\nThe emerging victor of this conflict was a hyper-adaptive, self-replicating nanite system that rapidly evolved to fit the planet's biosphere. This machine made itself the master of the surface world, breaking down anything from local flora to former, robotic rivals.\n\nWe bear witnessed to the aftermath of this great war: a planet not devoid of life, but instead supporting its evolved apex predator."
 anomaly.6705.a:0 "Tame the Swarm."
 anomaly.6705.b:0 "Study the Swarm further."

 anomaly.6710.name:0 "Artificial Immune System"
 anomaly.6710.desc.start:0 "The denizens of §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§! keep impressing. Any probe we send down into the atmosphere is quickly analyzed and taken apart by the swarm, and shortly thereafter the rest of its hive has learned how to best consume our drones as well - even on the far side of the planet. The swarm demonstrates a measurable increase in its understanding of our technology."
 anomaly.6710.desc.normal:0 "Some of our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] argue that this behavior is proof that the swarm is a sapient being - or beings - and might even be considered to be alive.\n\nIt is time to make a decision: do we let them be, destroy them, or else attempt to appropriate these beings for our own gain?"
 anomaly.6710.desc.gestalt:0 "These are the behaviors of a budding hivemind, and if left to its own devices, the nanite swarm may achieve sapience. Do we leave it in this state, or do we destroy it before it become a threat? Could we somehow appropriate this entity for our gain?"

 anomaly.6710.a:0 "Tame the Swarm."
 anomaly.6710.b:0 "Destroy the Swarm."
 anomaly.6710.c:0 "These are not mere automatons, but living beings!"

 anomaly.6715.name:0 "Fertilization of Nanites"
 anomaly.6715.desc:0 "While the nanite swarm of §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§! was impressive as a collective, as individuals they were quite vulnerable. Extracting a few from the planet's atmosphere and using our advanced AI technology, we have managed to reprogram the communication systems of the machines. Then when we reintroduced our reprogrammed nanites into the swarm, the modifications spread across the globe in a flash.\n\nWith control of the network secured, our first order was to reintroduce a stable biosphere onto §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§! - one which is optimized for [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. The planet is now ready and waiting for us, and the nanite swarm is prepared to help with any task our colonists may give it."

 anomaly.6720.desc:0 "The dust is settling after the [root.fleet.GetName] finished orbital bombardment of §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§!. Despite using a mix of powerful explosives and experimental EMPs, the process took a long time - but at last, there is no longer any trace of machine life down there.\n\nOur future colonists will have access to these gnats' remains and will, hopefully, manage to harvest something valuable from them."

 anomaly.6725.name:0 "Underprepared"
 anomaly.6725.desc:0 "Our precautions and special equipment were not enough. Shortly after establishing a colony on §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§!, we lost contact with our teams on the ground. The last communication we received from the settlement showed a sky darkened by small black bodies swarming the outpost."
 anomaly.6725.a:0 "Damn those nanites!"

 anomaly.6740.name:0 "The Color of Science"
 anomaly.6740.desc:0 "The cause of the solar radiation resonance observed around the corona of §Y[From.GetName]§! turned out to be an unusual crystal formation capable of enduring the heat!\n\nHaving brought the crystal aboard, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] were startled to realize that the strange resonance was reproducible. First, they exposed the crystal to the same solar radiation from [From.GetName], producing an identical result to the initially recorded phenomenon. It also seemed to create resonances with all energy waves we sent through it, forming new colors and sounds never before observed by [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!\n\nSuch frequencies could change the way we view the universe. Alternatively, we can develop research applications for a crystalline structure capable of surviving the intense heat of a star."
 anomaly.6740.a:0 "Send the new frequencies back to our artists."
 anomaly.6740.a.gestalt:0 "Retrieve these new frequencies for further analysis."

 anomaly.6745.name:0 "[From.GetName]"
 anomaly.6745.desc:0 "For as long as we [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have been able to look to the stars for new homes, [From.GetName] has been a naive dream: a place we would look to with optimism; a new home. Sadly as our telescopes got better, we realized that the planet would probably be a tidally locked, frozen hellscape - a theory which we have confirmed today.\n\nThere is hope, however; this world has all the building blocks necessary for a habitable planet. It might just need a slight push..."

 anomaly.6800.name:0 "Target Practice"
 anomaly.6800.desc:0 "Our sensors have discovered that the ship remnants on [From.GetName] got there in a peculiar way. The ships seem to have been intentionally driven straight into the asteroid, probably from light-years away, to test the accuracy of the designers' thrusters. As we deep-scan the remains, we pick out one ship in particular, which seems to have reasonably intact propulsion."
 anomaly.6800.a:0 "Recover that thruster!"
 anomaly.6800.b:1 "We won't waste those alloys."

 anomaly.6805.name:0 "Asteroid Sensor Relay"
 anomaly.6805.desc:0 "Hoping to discover rare resources inside [From.GetName], our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] stumbled upon something most unusual. What had appeared to be a simple asteroid was in fact a long-dormant relay station with complex electronics and advanced sensors set up to send signals back to an ancient empire. The impact also has damaged some of the asteroid's internal structure, and we can only extract one system from it."
 anomaly.6805.a:0 "Retrieve the Sensors."
 anomaly.6805.b:0 "Extrapolate their encryption software."

 anomaly.6810.name:0 "Infestation"
 anomaly.6810.desc:0 "We were wrong. The station orbiting [From.GetName] is not uninhabited; instead, it is crawling with giant alien arthropoids! The probes we deployed into the station only returned skittering shadows and large mandibles before signal was lost. Deep scans of the station have also revealed what we postulate to be an incredibly complex databank. To reach this databank, we would have to go through that cluster of many-legged defenders."
 anomaly.6810.a:0 "Send an away party, giant alien arthropoids are no joke!"
 anomaly.6810.b:0 "It's probably for the best that we leave them alone."

 anomaly.6815.desc:0 "Oh, hello there! Sorry about destroying your probe earlier. It's just that we are conducting some very delicate experiments here, and we were worried that outside interference could alter the results - I'm sure you understand. Now, how can we help you?"
 anomaly.6815.a:0 "Wait, so you are not a hostile infestation?"
 anomaly.6820.desc:1 "What would ever give you that impression? We are a Curator detachment sent here to study this system's unique properties. If you wish to partake of our order's usual offerings, I suggest contacting the primary research lab. I can provide you with a copy of our findings so far."
 anomaly.6820.a:0 "Good luck with your experiments."

 anomaly.6825.name:0 "Crystal Growths"
 anomaly.6825.desc.start:0 "The lifeforms living on [From.GetName] were nothing like we expected. Our [owner.GetScientistPlural] report back that the asteroid has crystal growths. These growths have turned out to be self-sustaining and caused by the crystals taking in the ambient radiation of [From.System.GetName] and combining it with the mineral composition of the asteroid."
 anomaly.6825.desc.nofood:0 "The crystals themselves are primarily made out of sucrose and are quite brittle."

 anomaly.6835.name:0 "Call for Crystals"
 anomaly.6835.desc:0 "After eating space-based crystal sugars for a few years now, it has become apparent that our population would like to see it more readily available. Our [Root.GetScientistPlural] have come up with a list of potential candidates where we could construct more crystal farms."

 anomaly.6840.name:0 "Too Few Sheep"
 anomaly.6840.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is a peculiar gas giant. Our knowledge of astrophysics tells us that the planet should have a planetary ring, yet it doesn't. The cause of this became apparent after our science ship took a closer look at the intriguing moon. The planet is surrounded by shepherd moons, all incredibly rich in minerals and accumulating more every year. We could blast the moons with precise and controlled explosions and harvest them or keep them inside the ring zone and harvest the space debris they accrue."
 anomaly.6840.a:0 "We need those minerals now."
 anomaly.6840.b:0 "Good things come to those who wait."

 anomaly.6845.name:0 "Cascading Catastrophe"
 anomaly.6845.desc:0 "We did indeed discover life on [From.GetName], but by our actions, it has since been eradicated. The microbial creatures which lived in the outer edges of the gas giant's atmosphere reacted poorly to our deep scans. These frequencies caused each creature's cellular structure to resonate - an effect that then cascaded and spread from gas mite to gas mite. Each was rendered inert soon after.\n\nWe are now in orbit over the largest graveyard in the universe."
 anomaly.6845.a:0 "Can anything be done?"
 anomaly.6850.name:0 "Reversing Deep Scan Polarities"
 anomaly.6850.desc:0 "It is done! Miraculously, once our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] installed the proper modifications on our vessel, they were able to recreate the initial cascade.

The tempest reacted to the probes being sent in, creating vacuum pockets to avoid them and then slowly seeping back in towards the drones. [Root.GetName] was planning on testing out numerous scanning frequencies at the storm before we lost contact. The science ship seems to have sunken into the gas giant and appears to be dormant."
 anomaly.6855.desc.gestalt:0 "The signals from [Root.GetName] were suddenly cut off from the consciousness. The [Owner.GetScientistPlural] do not appear to be dead, just unable to communicate with us.

The pod is built out of the exact same [Owner.GetBioAlloy] we ourselves use for spacebound structures. The likelihood that some alien beings would come up with this exact mixture is beyond unlikely, yet after recalibrating the scanners the same results appeared.\n\nUpon opening the pod, the only thing greeting us was a collection of documents detailing exactly where we should assign each of our [Owner.GetScientistPlural], and what they should study for 10 years forward."

 #Events

 colony.2060.name:0 "Mushroom Picking"
 colony.2060.desc:0 "A routine ecological study of our colony on [Root.GetName] has stumbled upon a strange fungal lifeform. The science team reports that the surface of the mycelium is shimmering and colorful, but what was most intriguing to them was the fact that separate clusters were seemingly communicating with one another whenever something occurred within a wide radius.\n\nFurthermore, the biology of the organism appears to be clearly alien to the ecosystem of the colony. Puzzled, the local science team has requested specialized support as we might be dealing with a sentient species."
 colony.2060.a:0 "Dispose of them."
 colony.2060.b:0 "Take a closer look"
 colony.2060.c:0 "... They are related to the Fumongus!"
 colony.2065.name:0 "The Spores Have Ears"
 colony.2065.desc:0 "We have concerning reports coming from [Root.GetName]. Upon further examination, it seems that the alien fungus we found is emitting a signal towards a location in the galaxy that we were unable to pinpoint so far. Telemetry and security analysis indicate that it is completely possible for the mycelium to be some kind of advanced spying organism.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that this organism is old. There is a fair chance that whomever engineered these spying mushrooms is not around anymore. But if they are, it might be best not to poke the sleeping predator."
 colony.2065.a:0 "We need to know more."
 colony.2065.b:0 "This is too risky. Destroy them."
 colony.2070.intro:0 "Careful analysis of the mycelium and the signals showed that it was likely part of a network of similar organisms, possibly spanning across the galaxy as a whole, and maybe beyond. While we do not know much, we discovered that as part of the network, this mycelium was also receiving signals from other places."
 colony.2070.name:0 "Someone is Listening"
 colony.2070.desc:0 "$colony.2070.intro$\n\nWe cannot be certain, but considering several factors, including the volume of data transferred, we believe that someone is actively using the network and collecting information from it. We are already working on a counter-intelligence plan of disinformation, and security measures are being updated empire wide to account for this form of spycraft."
 colony.2070.a:0 "Let the disinformation begin!"
 colony.2075.name:0 "No One Listens"
 colony.2075.desc:0 "$colony.2070.intro$\n\nConsidering several factors, including the volume of data transferred, we do not think that the network is still in use. The fact that it is still partially active indicates that it is probably just dormant and not destroyed."

 colony.2080.name:0 "Spore Connection"
 colony.2080.desc:0 "Whatever doubts we had about this fungus' connection to the mycelial listening array were quickly dispelled after a brief comparison. This is one of the many offsprings communicating with the Fumongus, and this could be an opportunity to further our comprehension of the organism."
 colony.2080.a:0 "See if we can strengthen the network."
 colony.2080.b:0 "Use it to keep a closer eye on the colony."
 colony.2080.c:0 "We dismantled the network, but we can still study it."
 colony.2085.name:0 "Unrest on [Root.GetName]"
 colony.2085.desc:0 "Word about our project to use the local mycelium to closely monitor the colony has spread, and it wasn't well received. Despite our best efforts to defuse the situation, the local population widely considers this as a breach of trust and are demanding that we put an end to this project immediately.\n\nThe situation is escalating quickly, and our local enforcers are overwhelmed. They would need help to maintain control of the colony if we choose to go on with the project."
 colony.2085.a:0 "The population is right. Abort."
 colony.2085.b:0 "If they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear."
 colony.2090.name:0 "The Spores Are Our Ears"
 colony.2090.desc:0 "We have grown the mycelium on [Root.GetName], and fine-tuned the local computing equipment to sort through the interference. The responsible team reports that the network is now closely monitoring the colonists. Already, a number of petty criminals have been sanctioned appropriately.\n\nUnfortunately, attempts at replicating the installation in other places have met with failure. It is likely that some unknown factor is at play here."
 colony.2095.name:0 "Fungal Failure"
 colony.2095.desc:0 "Our efforts to stimulate the spread of the mycelium on [Root.GetName] have resulted in the growth of more 'traditional' mushrooms. An incident with some colonists has shown them to be edible. This event has thrown the whole network off balance for a while, but it now appears to be stabilized and functional. However, no significant improvement has been noticed overall. It looks like these mushrooms are merely storage for water. They do not contribute to the network and their destruction has no impact on it either."

Our translation algorithms have succeeded in decoding much of the symbology, and this particular image likely represents the planet's moon.\n\nWithin the cave, the presence of psionic energy is so strong that the team has described it as something like an unseen fog. Unfortunately, the path ahead was blocked by a cave-in several centuries ago, but given time, the expedition should be able to find a way through."

Formed drop-by-drop over the course of several millennia, the pillar appears to be the source of the planet's strange, psionic energy. The team has discovered evidence of religious ritual, as well as several small artifacts of ceremonial significance scattered around the pillar.

 SINGING_PLANET_CAT_DESC:0 "This planet emits strange magnetic waves, quite unlike anything we have seen so far, almost as if it is trying to communicate with us. It is only logical to investigate this unusual phenomenon - we may have just encountered an extraordinary example of life on a planetary scale."

 anomaly.7101.name:0 "Singing Planet"
 anomaly.7101.standard.desc:0 "What we first assumed to be a deliberate attempt at communication has turned out to be an unusual but naturally occurring phenomenon. The magnetic waves produced by the planet, given proper handling and editing, may sound a bit like talking or even singing, but they are in no way created by a thinking being. Some of our scientists, however, find it quite catchy.\n\nIt might be possible to make use of this phenomenon, possibly by hosting artists or VIPs at a station created solely to catch these signals and play them as relaxing music."
 anomaly.7101.a:0 "Fascinating."
 anomaly.7101.machines.desc:0 "The planet is emitting a series of signals that our exploratory drones speculated might be of artificial origin. Upon closer examination, the signals were revealed to be merely a natural phenomenon caused by unusual but harmless magnetic waves.

 # Ancient Manufactorium

 colony.9200.name:0 "Hidden Vault" #starting the event
 colony.9200.desc:0 "During a standard reconnaissance of [Root.GetName], the planetary exploration unit came across a massive door that apparently leads directly into the interior of a mountain range. It appears that the strong magnetic field produced by some sort of cloaking device hid it from our ship's sensors, and the camouflaged entrance remained invisible to the autonomous research probes mapping the surface.\n\nOn the other hand, more specialized tests have shown that delivering a steady stream of energy should make the door operational again, eventually allowing us to open it and see what's inside."
 colony.9200.a:0 "Provide the energy." #go on with chain
 colony.9200.a.desc:0 "Setting up the grid might take some time, and will continue to sip the energy during the exploration of the vault."

 colony.9201.name:0 "Darkness Awaits" #entered the vault
 colony.9201.desc:0 "As energy flowed through the circuits, the entrance came online, and with additional tinkering, we quickly discovered how the door worked. Additional topographical research revealed the interior to be a large underground vault. Alien infrastructure covered every square centimeter of the walls - even the huge pillars supporting the ceiling showed faint energy signatures. Given the energy readings and vague similarities to our technology, it appears to be an underground manufacturing facility."
 colony.9201.a:0 "We will learn it secrets." #go forward
 colony.9201.a.desc:0 "Given the scope of this operation, it will take a lot of resources, workforce, and an unknown amount of time to study it thoroughly. Regular updates and reports on their work are somewhat to be expected."

 colony.9202.desc:0 "Those far from the vault could feel the ground shake. Those closer could see a large chunk of the mountainside fly off into the air, creating a huge crater filled with rocks, debris, and twisted machinery. A quick guess as to what could have gone wrong led to the conclusion that a chain reaction was set in motion inside the vault when the initial explosion breached the door.\n\nRegardless, a smoking crater is all that is left of the underground vault."
 colony.9202.a:0 "It's safer this way."

 colony.9210.name:0 "Disappearances!" #first problem
 colony.9210.desc:0 "The initial phase of research on [Root.GetName] was largely focused on mapping the entrance. The first room within the vault is a giant hall, stretching deep into the mountain, with several branching corridors pushing even further into the depths. Various ornate plaques decorate stone chiseled pillars, each depicting the alien race that presumably built this place. We can't decipher their language, but the story told by those art pieces are centered on warfare, struggle, and grandiose projects.\n\nMore disturbing is the loss of an entire construction unit; after reporting the presence of strange sounds in the dark, the unit simply vanished. The situation is in danger of slipping out of control and calls for more decisive action."
 colony.9210.a:0 "Double the security forces and search for them." #casual

It turns out that this vault still has operational traps and devices that were programmed to trap unwanted visitors within "boxes" comprised of dislocated and moving walls.\n\nThe unfortunate workers were all killed within the trap. Our citizenry is furious at the result, but at least now we know what to look for."
 colony.9211.a:0 "That's terrible."

 colony.9212.name:0 "Workers Rescued" #egalitarian - pop survives, negative modifier only
 colony.9212.desc:0 "Given the enormous search team, it didn't take long to find the missing workers. The last of them were discovered trapped in a square prison-like structure made of articulated and self-moving walls. It appears that the security systems within the vault are still operational. Given this, we will be more prepared to counter such contraptions in the future. Nonetheless, the population is angry that the workers were not provided with proper safety measures in the first place."

 colony.9213.desc:0 "The missing workers were found in a grotesque contraption that imprisoned them between four movable walls. Unfortunately, these individuals are no longer of any use to the empire, but at least their sacrifice revealed the existence of the trap. The work now continues undisturbed, and the population working on the site feels some relief, knowing that they should be safe - for now."

It looks like whoever built this place took special care of it - there are many statues here in excellent condition, depicting bipedal individuals. With some traces of detail they have mostly a uniform appearance. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of what this hall was, other than some monumental tribute to probably historical figures."

Most of the workers have found safety, but one group is in a remote hall that could be at risk of collapse. They reported two distinct, ancient machines there - one being a bulky contraption connected to the ground, and the other attached to the walls via a series of pipes. We can't say if they are anything important for the facility. The workers have estimated that may be possible to use one of those machines to reinforce the ceiling and walls against the quake."

 colony.9240.desc:0 "Our exploration on [Root.GetName] finally yielded some insights. Our first assessment turned out to be correct. The vault is in fact a giant foundry. Further analysis of the alien language reveals that it was referred to as a King-Forge. However, the Forge was never operational - its builders apparently lacked the technology to see the project through to completion.\n\nIt should be possible for us to finish their work as long as we can get into the heart of the foundry. Although the way is blocked by heavy doors, our engineers insist they can be overcome. However, as the doors don't have any obvious locking or opening mechanisms, a certain application of force will be required before we can proceed."

 INTEMPORAL_ORB_CAT_DESC:0 "We have discovered powerful concentrated energy in the form of an orb. Investigation is advised."

## Event: Concentrated Energy
 anomaly.7105.name:0 "Concentrated Energy"
 anomaly.7105.desc:0 "The source of the unusual energy readings noted on [From.GetName] is confirmed to be a small, blue orb. The [Owner.GetScientistPlural] report that sensors pick up tachyons of reverse polarity.\n\nSymbols are carved into the ground around the object, perhaps placed there by an older civilization. It is unclear whether they are meant as an instruction, or a warning.\n\nThe full inscription is far from translated, but individual symbols seem related to the measuring of time and the relative positions of celestial objects in the [Solar_System.GetName] system."

## Event: Local Time Reversal
 anomaly.7110.name:0 "Local Time Reversal"
 anomaly.7110.desc:0 "The orb of blue energy first detected on [FromFrom.GetName] has disappeared. A scan of the location show no traces of the strange sphere. Even more baffling is the erasure of the markings on the ground: it is as if they were never there.\n\nGiven the unusual tachyon readings we detected at the site, our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] postulate that both the orb and the writing were moving backwards through time."

In front of [leader.GetHimHer], blue energy arced out of the timestream and was absorbed by [leader.GetHisHer] body. Although the incident was accurately measured by the other [Owner.GetScientistPlural] to span less than a second, [leader.GetHeShe] experienced it for more than a hour.\n\nAfter the vision ended, [Root.GetLeaderName] was certain that time would no longer affect [leader.GetHimHer].
