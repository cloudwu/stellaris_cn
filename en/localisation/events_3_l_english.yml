 anomaly.4000.name:0 "Life Finds a Way"
 anomaly.4000.desc:0 "It appears that some of [From.GetName]'s flora has developed effective defense mechanisms through natural selection. Numerous trees and fungi exude spores that act like a powerful acidic on non-plant organisms. Thankfully Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has found a way to counteract some strands of these spores, making the planet's forests less threatening to us!"

 anomaly.4005.name:0 "On the Shoulders of Giants"
 anomaly.4005.desc:0 "It appears that the asteroid [Root.GetName] and the surrounding debris originates from a former planet!\n\nDeep within the center of the asteroids we can find traces of extremely valuable minerals. There is also hints of bacterial life that has now died in the vacuum of space. This shows us that the celestial body once bore the promise of life."
 anomaly.4005.a.tooltip:1 "Adds the §YEx-Planet§! modifier to [From.GetName]:\n£minerals  §G+5§!"
 anomaly.4010.name:0 "Lost in Space"
 anomaly.4010.desc:0 "The signal we intercepted was a distress call from a ship in orbit around [From.GetName]. The ship is not giving away any heat signatures and seems to be drifting. A §SSpecial Project§! has been issued to investigate what has happened to the crew."
 anomaly.4011.desc:0 "The crew of the ship has been found dead. What is more disturbing is that they appear to have been killed by some highly advanced brain parasites, which infested them and turned them mad. Thanks to Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName]'s findings we could protect our own crew from being infected!"
 anomaly.4012.desc:0 "The ship in orbit around [From.From.From.GetName] was not abandoned. The crew is alive, but not well, influenced by some sort of brain parasite. With the help of our scientists they could easily be cured."

 anomaly.4012.b:0 "Let them perish."
 anomaly.4015.name:0 "The Final Rest"
 anomaly.4015.desc:0 "By what has to be beyond astronomical odds, the [Root.GetName] actually managed to pinpoint the source of the odd signals as it soared past through the asteroid belt. A tiny, alien construct. A simple scan reveals that it is some sort of a ritualistic container, holding the remains of an alien spacefarer."

 anomaly.4035.name:0 "Fire of the Furnace"
 anomaly.4035.desc:0 "We have made an interesting find on [From.GetName], however it is not related to the [From.GetPlanetMoon] itself. While conducting our usual tests we captured some odd data from a far-off system's star. Its radiation indicates that it is able to fuse together beryllium without spallation; something that should not be possible!\n\nThe science team are eager to investigate and have limited the potential stars down to two not-too-distant systems.\nConsult the §SSituation Log§! for details." #Source: http://www.forbes.com/sites/ethansiegel/2015/07/01/the-only-three-heavy-elements-in-the-universe-that-arent-made-in-stars/

 anomaly.4037.name:0 "Correct System"
 anomaly.4037.desc:0 "We seem to have found the right system! The radiation data of the local star match the ones previously encountered. A §SSpecial Project§! has been issued to perform research on the star."
 anomaly.4038.base.desc:0 "Eureka! Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has found that the star is formed around a miniscule wormhole, which has ripped open a dimensional rift. Rays from this other dimension has replaced the need of cosmic rays in spallation, the process of supernovae radiation reducing the beryllium-8 created in stars into a stable element. The star is thus unique in its fusion capabilities."
 anomaly.4038.maxed.desc:0 "$anomaly.4038.base.desc$\n\nThis knowledge won't expand our available technology. However, it grants us more insight into what makes the universe tick."

 anomaly.4040.name:0 "Sins of a Sun"
 anomaly.4040.desc:0 "The ionizing radiation on [From.GetName] are off the charts. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] seems to either have been bombarded with nuclear warheads quite recently or been exposed to a concentrated beam of cosmic rays, perhaps from a nearby supernova. How the latter could ever be achieved is beyond Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName]."
 anomaly.4040.a.tooltip:1 "Adds the §RIrradiated Wasteland§! modifier to [From.GetName]:\n£blocker  Radioactive Wasteland §R+6\n£physics  §G+3§!"
 anomaly.4045.name:0 "Echoes from the Deep"
 anomaly.4045.desc:0 "After rigorous research, the crew of [Root.GetName] has only been able to detect a faint "echo" emanating deep beneath the surface of [From.GetName].\n\nThe echo resembles a life signature, however it is so distant it is hard to tell if it is real or just the instruments giving off random variations. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName]'s crew is complaining about bad rest and long hours and cannot take much more."
 anomaly.4045.a:0 "Calibrate the scanners and look closer to the core!"
 anomaly.4045.b:0 ""The crew cannot be trusted. An expedition is needed!""
 anomaly.4045.c:0 "The crew's health comes first."
 anomaly.4045.d:0 "We cannot rest until we get to the bottom of this!"
 anomaly.4046.desc:0 "After doing some adjustments to the ship scanners, the crew of [Root.GetName] and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], although exhausted and on edge, have made a startling discovery. Close to the core of [From.From.GetName] is a plankton-like lifeform that stretches across the entire [From.From.GetPlanetMoon], living in a shared consciousness with vast psionic abilities.\n\nThe lifeform is able to survive under both extreme pressures and temperatures. It can even expand itself at rapid rates. It seem to either be hibernating or... hiding, as if it knew it was being watched.\n\nA lifeform this vast in size and versatile seems technically immortal§!. However it does not seem like it would hinder us to colonize the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon], but it might have a negative influence on the population."
 anomaly.4046.a:0 "We should try and contact it."
 anomaly.4046.b:0 "We could poison the ocean to kill it."
 anomaly.4046.c:0 "Better to leave it alone."
 anomaly.4046.c.tooltip:1 "§YYour Empire§! gains the §RNegative Media Coverage§! modifier.\n\nAdds the §RHostile Environment§! modifier to [From.From.GetName].\n\nAdds the §YAncient One§! modifier to [From.From.GetName]:\n£society  §G+4§!"
 anomaly.4047.desc:0 "After trying several methods of contact without an answer the team decides to try sonar pings§!. The sound waves cause a massive reaction in the being and every crew member falls to their knees, struck with vivid visions.\n\nThis seems to be the creatures' main form of communication. It depicts its homeworld, where it lies alone near the core basking in the warmth of the [From.From.From.GetPlanetMoon], thriving in the darkness. Then it shows our people, standing on the surface, thriving in the sunshine."
 anomaly.4047.a:0 "We gladly accept this invitation."
 anomaly.4047.a.tooltip:1 "§YYour Empire§! gains the §RNegative Media Coverage§! modifier.\n\nAdds the §YAncient One§! modifier to [From.From.From.GetName]:\n£society  §G+4§!"
 anomaly.4048.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] quickly synthesizes a poison that should react well with the creature's interconnected form and spread like wildfire.\n\nAfter releasing the poison the crew stare in horror as they bear witness to an unprecedented event. [From.From.From.GetName]'s core temperature spirals out of control which causes the oceans to boil. The creature's gargantuan body also releases toxins into the atmosphere. The plankton entity must have been vital in the regulation of the [From.From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s unstable center, as well as developed toxic defense mechanisms in order to protect itself.\n\nThe [From.From.From.GetPlanetMoon] becomes completely toxic in a matter of hours."
 anomaly.4048.a:0 "..."

 anomaly.4049.desc:0 "Suspicious that the crew is hiding something, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] decided to mount an unauthorized solo-expedition to examine the planet's core. A video feed from the ships submarine shows what happened:\n\nGoing deep into the oceans of [From.From.GetName] there is only darkness, but also something... alive. Inside deep-sea caverns close to the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s warm core there are webs of plankton-like vegetation§!, that spans the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s entire crust.\n\nWhile investigating the plankton [Root.GetLeaderName] is stricken with a seizure§!, only to awake hours later.\n\nAfter returning to the [Root.GetName] the Science Officer is delusional and only speaks of horrors and haunted dreams."

 anomaly.4050.desc:0 "It has been a week since the incident on [From.From.From.GetName] when the crew of the [Root.GetName] are disturbed by a loud scream. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is yelling, running through the halls of the ship, going on about inexplicable pains.\n\nThe crew brings the poor scientist to the sickbay and after heavy sedation and a thorough examination concludes that [Root.GetLeaderName]'s brain has changed.\n\nAfter further tests the team startlingly realizes that their leader is now capable of telekinesis and communicating with others via telepathy. [Root.GetLeaderName] is going to get healthy, after some rest."
 anomaly.4050.a:0 "Glad to have you back."

 anomaly.4051.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName]'s crew ends their research of [From.From.GetName], thankful of finally getting some rest. Sadly there were not any useful finds, but news of the crew being well-treated spreads fast and brings forth many a good word on our homeworld. Being well-rested should also have the crew produce even better results in the long run."

 anomaly.4051.a:0 "The crew's well-being is its own reward."
 anomaly.4051.b:0 "This is but one way to gain efficiency."
 anomaly.4052.desc:0 "After working day and night in order to find the reason behind the echo, the crew of [Root.GetName] have found an interesting lifeform living underneath the surface of [From.From.GetName]. Previously we could not detect it due to its amazing ability to live so close to the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s core, throwing off our systems analytics.\n\nScans show it to be a type of aquatic arthropod early in its evolution, but what is most surprising is the fact that it is able to reproduce by repurposing dead matter from other lifeforms into offspring.\n\nThis information will surely help our scientists to develop new pharmaceuticals! However, news of how we treated our personnel will surely spread and displease the general populace."

 anomaly.4060.spirit.b:0 "Surely this is a sign of the divine."
 anomaly.4061.desc:0 "We have tried everything in order to find out how the ceramic pot ended up in a stellar orbit. Maybe we are all crazy? Maybe it does not even exist? Guess what? We tried calculating around those facts as well! We are done. There is nothing more we can do here.\n\nThe only plus side to this is that we had tons of time to spend on philosophical and economical questions, when we could not stomach to keep investigating that damned thing."

 anomaly.4065.a:0 "Try and stop the machine."
 anomaly.4066.upg.desc:0 "We managed to stop the excavator before it broke down. It's a remarkable piece of machinery, with a smooth surface covered in diamonds.

 anomaly.4075.desc:0 "Having probed the frozen landscapes of the [From.GetPlanetMoon] [From.GetName] we think we have struck something big. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] speaks of a bacterial lifeform unlike any other. It bonds with other individuals to form large "blankets" that are durable yet light, and also acts like solar cells. They absorb solar energy with a surprisingly low efficiency loss percentage, most likely a result of evolution favoring those who could gather more heat in the harsh climate.\n\nOur researchers back home could surely find some use of this information."

 anomaly.4085.desc:0 "Among the asteroids surrounding [From.GetName], we have discovered an alien ship adrift. It is not responding to our attempts to hail them. If this is due to it being unable to interpret our signal, or some other reason, we do not know.\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] recommends that we get a construction ship to tow it out of the debris field. If left untouched, it risks being crushed by the asteroids.\n\nA §SSpecial Project§! has been issued to save the ship and investigate it."
 anomaly.4086.desc:0 "Once the ship drifting by [From.From.From.GetName] had been towed out of the debris, we could send in an away team to investigate. It is a murder scene. Only one crew member has been found - a long-eared, amphibian biped who appears to have been stabbed repeatedly. The ship is, by the death of its crew, up for grabs.\n\nIt is fitted with very efficient thrusters, the structure and design of which are beyond us at present. The vessel is not armed, seemingly having been used as a transport for important personnel.\n\nRepurposing it into an exploration vessel would be a minor undertaking.
