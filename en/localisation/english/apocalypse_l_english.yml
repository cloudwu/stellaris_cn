While the proposed Colossus ships could carry payloads capable of complete planetary annihilation, we will deploy them using a less violent - but nevertheless terrifyingly permanent - method of conflict resolution.\n\nIf a hypothetical enemy will not cease their aggression toward us or our allies, we must simply §Rmake them§!."
 apoc.100.desc.milit:0 "Previously spoken of only in hushed voices, and before then only in whispers in the most labyrinthine corridors of military skunkworks facilities, the Colossus Project now enjoys official sanction. Possibly the single greatest military innovation the galaxy will ever see, the Colossus Project comprises the development of a §RPlanet-Killer§! weapons platform as well as a Colossus hull configuration to carry it. The Colossus vessels will likely require an escort as the projected demands of a Planet-Killer weapon preclude any other armament.\n\nNevertheless, the Colossus, once developed, promises to be perhaps the single most destructive force in the galaxy."
