 astral_rift.1.name: "Ruined Planet"
 astral_rift.1.desc.common.1: "Our voyage into the rift near [explorer.capital_scope.GetName] has delivered us into the orbit of a planet in ruins.\n\nUpon entering the atmosphere, we discovered a landscape pock-marked with burning craters. Here and there, warships lay half buried in the sands. This world is a battlefield.\n\nIntercepted radio transmissions are frenzied and unnerving. Incredibly,"
 astral_rift.1.desc.no_arcsite: "the inhabitants appear to be communicating in an archaic version of our own language."
 astral_rift.1.desc.with_arcsite: "the language of the inhabitants matched precisely with the documents we recovered from the ancient sphere beneath [explorer.capital_scope.GetName]."
 astral_rift.1.desc.common.2: "Rough translations indicate these people are on the losing side of an enduring conflict. Their foes, referred to simply as "The Invaders", are preparing another wave of attack. Given the devastation on the planet, it may well be the last."

 astral_rift.3.desc.default: "There are several large population centers on the surface of the planet. Based on their transmissions, we have identified two distinct ideological factions.\n\nThe §Y[GetStarlightVanguardName]§! are grim militarists, preparing for the coming conflict with unified determination.\n\nThe §YBlack Curtain§! are a priestly order, promising spiritual sanctuary from the looming threat.\n\nAt this point, we are certain that the similarities in our languages cannot be mere coincidence. These are our living ancestors, and both factions are in danger."
 astral_rift.3.desc.hive: "$astral_rift.3.desc.default$\n\nThese people use our language. Their physiognomy is nearly identical to our own. Yet they possess individual minds. How can that be?"
 astral_rift.3.desc.machine: "These are individual units! Far from a networked consciousness, each one has its own processesing power and decision making capabilities. There are several large population centers on the surface of the planet.

 astral_rift.5.spiritualist_1: "We opened a dialogue with the spiritualist faction that calls themselves the "§YBlack Curtain§!"."
 astral_rift.5.common_1: "Our language, appearance, and the presence of a §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§! quickly convinced them of our common heritage. In their desperation to communicate, they revealed much about our history.\n\nLong ago, our species was confronted by an extradimensional threat. The invaders arrived to wage a brutal extermination campaign. At first our people stood firm, but over time their defenses crumbled.\n\nOn the eve of defeat, an Astral Rift appeared."
 astral_rift.5.militarist_2: "Operation "Life Boat" was launched in a bid to escape through the rift and preserve what remained of their civilization."
 astral_rift.5.spiritualist_2: "This "Miracle Door" was seen as a last chance to escape and preserve what remained of their way of life."
 astral_rift.5.no_arcsite: "A §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§! was constructed, but its rudimentary design only allowed for a one-way journey."
 astral_rift.5.arcsite: "$astral_rift.5.no_arcsite$ This was the very object we found buried deep inside the ancient crater in [explorer.capital_scope.GetName]."
 astral_rift.5.default: "A select group of refugees was prepped for the mission. These were our ancestors."
 astral_rift.5.gestalt: "In order to withstand the journey, a select group of compatible individuals were radically transformed. Our ancestors believed that only a unified mind could hope to pass through the rift unscathed. This was the very beginning of our consciousness."
 astral_rift.5.machine: "In order to survive the journey, our progenitors linked their minds and purged their emotions. With a clear vision and a unified purpose our concciousness was formed."
 astral_rift.5.common_2: "On this side of the rift, the Sphere was launched less than fifty years ago. There are some among the people here who still remember that day. For us, eons have passed."

 astral_rift.10.desc.common: ""Your arrival has inspired our people. Give us the critical aid we need, and we yet have a chance to end this war once and for all." Their remaining fleets are in poor condition and cannot withstand another loss.\n\nWe should be able to send a limited amount of supplies through the anchor cable before the rift becomes too unstable. A shipment of direly needed alloys will help with fleet repairs and enhancements. Given the advanced construction of their ships, we may learn something of their designs along the way.\n\nA wiser use of our time may be to apply our more advanced knowledge of astral thread into enhancing their ship's shields. While experimental in nature, we may make some breakthroughs here that could benefit our own fleets. It is our understanding that the invaders favor energy weapons, so any improvements here would go a long way."

A visible current of energy can be seen flowing through a grid of branching conduits.\n\nThe corridors here seem as if they infinitely repeat themselves with no significant variation. We are making no progress with our current exploration. Making our own path is advised."

 astral_rift.100.b: "Open the walls."

 astral_rift.105.name: "Impossible "Glass""
 astral_rift.105.desc: "Our initial attempts to break through the floor were unsuccessful. Its composition is unlike any known transparent material we have on record. Blunt force will not deform or blemish the surface.\n\nHowever, with a considerable amount of effort, we succeeded in creating a small hole through one of the conduits with a plasma drill. Flowing through the circuitry is a highly concentrated mixture of tightly-woven astral fabric.\n\nAs interesting as this discovery is, it does not seem practical to carve our own passageway through this floor. We will return to exploring in a more traditional manner."

 astral_rift.110.name: "Regeneration"
 astral_rift.110.desc: "The walls here are easily deconstructed, but this is short-lived.\n\nVery soon after any amount of material is removed from the walls, a crystalline network of rudimentary construction materials begins weaving and layering itself on top of one another into a close approximation of what existed before. We can see energy in the conduits below us flow toward the site of each of our deconstructions.\n\nAs interesting as this discovery is, it does not seem practical to carve our own passageway through this floor. We will return to exploring in a more traditional manner."

 astral_rift.120.name: "Entombed"
 astral_rift.120.desc: "In the process of decoding the terminal, a failsafe was triggered and the entire room quickly filled with an expansive foam-like material. Before anyone could assist [Leader.GetName], [Leader.GetHeShe] [Leader.GetWasWere] completely encased. Any attempts to uncover [Leader.GetHimHer] were fruitless, as what material could be removed was instantly replaced.\n\nAs is standard procedure, we have retracted the emergency anchor and recovered the §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§! and its collected samples."

 astral_rift.125.name: "A Formula"
 astral_rift.125.desc: "[Leader.GetName] [Leader.GetWasWere] able to decompile the code. The programming language itself is highly advanced and the algorithms have an elegant simplicity.\n\nThis entire structure has been procedurally generated.\n\nThough we have not fully deciphered its patterns, there is very clearly a set of rules this environment is following. We are taking back samples of the building materials which have shown to possess some unique self replicating properties. Further testing is required, but we theorize that placing this material in any location and applying the correct instructions will generate an entirely new system of similar corridors."

 astral_rift.200.desc: "This rift contains the aftermath of a titanic struggle.\n\nAll that is left is the wreckage of a military fleet and the corpse of a monstrous creature, ten times the largest of the battleships from tip to tail.\n\nIn contrast to the mangled hulls of the warships, the carcass is in remarkably good shape. Whatever weapons these ships used, they seem to have hardly damaged it. We have not yet determined what caused this creature's demise, but it seems unlikely it was the result of the battle.\n\nThe beast must have had remarkable durability. Analyzing its molecular composition should help us strengthen the hulls of our fleet. On the other hand, we could attempt to study its internals, perhaps learning how this creature died, and what exactly occurred here."
 astral_rift.200.a: "Study its composition."
 astral_rift.200.b: "Let's get in there."

 astral_rift.205.name: "Exotic Armor"
 astral_rift.205.desc: "The material composition of the leviathan's armor is beyond our expectations.\n\nIts scales contain a mix of organic and metallic components locked together in a complex lattice that reinforces itself against kinetic shock. It is a true marvel of nature.\n\nUnderstanding the principles behind it have inspired our engineers to rethink how we construct the hulls of our own spaceships.\n\nThis must have been a terrifying adversary to meet in battle."
 astral_rift.205.a: "$FASCINATING$"

 astral_rift.210.name: "Uncharted Body"
 astral_rift.210.desc: "We have entered the derelict carcass.\n\nWhile we were unable to penetrate the remarkable armor of the creature, we did succeed in opening its mouth with the aid of a large quantity of explosives. A small team ventured through the mouth of the beast to better understand its internals and collect samples of its tissues.\n\nThe interior is fascinating. Countless rows of sharp teeth indicate that this was a predatory organism. A very efficient digestive system occupied the majority of its bulk, and revealed that this creature was in the habit of consuming a wide variety of materials.\n\nWe were also able to estimate the time and cause of death: despite the creature's omnivorous habits, there were clear signs of dehydration. This could indicate that it is not native to this dimension, finding nothing here to drink.\n\nBased on carbon-dating, this organism passed away over fifty thousand years ago."
 astral_rift.210.a: "$FASCINATING$"

 astral_rift.215.name: "A Dozen Faces"
 astral_rift.215.desc: "We've examined the remains of the warships within this rift.\n\nThe smooth surfaces of the alien crafts bear similarities to the design of our §Y$tech_rift_sphere_plural$§!. Remarkably, it seems that these vessels were designed to freely enter and exit rifts without the need of anchor cable extraction.\n\nWhile our engineers worked on understanding this technology, the rest of the team discovered a large dodecahedron nestled in the interior of the largest wreck. Without further testing it is impossible to speculate on its purpose, but its careful storage indicates it would have been regarded as important."
 astral_rift.215.a: "Try to activate the dodecahedron."
 astral_rift.215.b: "Strip it for parts."

 astral_rift.220.name: "Activation"
 astral_rift.220.desc: "Our team brought the dodecahedron aboard the §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§! for further examination.\n\nA reinvestigation of its original housing found trace amounts of astral thread. Feeding some into the dodecahedron caused the object to vibrate at a frequency so high that its blurred form began to resemble a sphere.\n\nWhile the device was active, the rift we entered through was sealed. As soon as the device was 'switched off', it reappeared.\n\nBased on this experiment, we can suppose that faced with a foe they could not destroy, some ancient empire used this technology in a desperate attempt to lock the creature away, sacrificing their fleet in the process.\n\nThis remarkable device could prove a significant boon for us."
 astral_rift.220.a: "$FASCINATING$"

 astral_rift.225.name: "Disassembly"
 astral_rift.225.desc: "The dodecahedron was a treasure trove of rare materials. Its internals were dense with $astral_threads$ in patterns that suggested a complicated network of circuitry. The central core housed a significant quantity of Dark Matter. How this artifact worked remains a mystery, but we can certainly make use of its base components."

Attempts to analyze the material that makes up this universe are baffling. No matter how intensely the samples are magnified, we are confronted by the same repeating patterns. It is as if they condense towards infinity.\n\nClearly, there are physical principles operating inside of this rift that we do not yet understand."

Propelling forward, we shift left; increasing our thrust, we slow down.\n\nA breakthrough was made when [Leader.GetName] theorized that this universe allows access to more than the standard three spatial dimensions. Perhaps by examining our surroundings through this lens we can begin to find meaning in these patterns."

 astral_rift.315.desc.common: "By extrapolating the patterns of our surroundings in four spatial dimensions, we've succeeded in creating a useable map. This has revealed the existence of a 'central chamber' within the repeated patterns.\n\nWhile from the perspective of four dimensions our travel to the middle of the rift was a straight line, our own experience was a twisting trajectory through an incomprehensible labyrinth. Sharp turns and the occasional backtrack were required to traverse this maze, but we eventually reached our goal.\n\nThis new space is vast; it is far too large to logically be contained within the chamber itself, and must be the result of even more folded dimensions.\n\nAt its very center, we recovered a familiar device. Written in our own language, it was a set of instructions on how to proceed further."

At various points, we witnessed ourselves crossing from another course. Some of our other copies appeared to be in distress, with the wear and corrosion on their §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§! indicating they have been lost in this space for much too long.\n\nLuckily, we have avoided direct encounters thus far. We have left our own instructions behind us to prevent such a dangerous temporal simultaneity from occurring."
 astral_rift.320.a: "Unsettling..."

 astral_rift.325.name: "Fractal Seeds"
 astral_rift.325.desc: "At last we have reached the center of what must be the true end of this maze.\n\nWe are in a space composed of so many unknown dimensions that our senses can only perceive it as a wild kaleidoscope of colors and motion. At its very core, three transparent globes are floating, each containing an infinitely repeating pattern in one axial direction. We suspect that there must be a globe for each dimension contained in this universe, but we can only interact with our perceivable three.\n\nThere are no further instructions to be found. This lack of messages from our future selves could indicate that interacting with these globes may have dire consequences."
 astral_rift.325.a: "Retrieve the globes."
 astral_rift.325.b: "We are done here."

 astral_rift.330.name: "Dimensional Containers"
 astral_rift.330.desc: "As we returned back through the rift, two other Spheres came with us. Presumably crewed by other versions of ourselves, we 'three' fused (or were reduced?) into one at its threshold.\n\nStrangely, the three orbs we recovered did not converge in the same manner. Nine temporal versions of the same objects now exist in one space.\n\nWhen placed in individual containers, they naturally bend themselves into an extra dimension and increase the effective size of their surrounding space. We are not sure yet of the limits of this expansion, but theorize these devices could be of great use in densely populated areas."

We have no way to determine our bearings.\n\nOur altimeters, depth gauges, and compasses are completely inoperable or clearly in error. Visually, there is absolutely no deviation from the empty whiteness surrounding us.\n\nPerhaps if we travel far enough we can escape these disruptions. Alternatively, we could explore this area in more detail with the help of a drone."
 astral_rift.700.a: "Maximize propulsion."
 astral_rift.700.b: "Release a drone."

 astral_rift.705.name: "The Wall"
 astral_rift.705.desc: "We have struck out in a random direction and have come upon a black wall.\n\nNavigating around its perimeter, we discovered it to be a near-perfect circle. There is no visible entrance, but now and then its surface shudders ever so slightly, as if it were alive.\n\nFurther study indicated that the wall is increasing its diameter over time. We are taking precautions to keep a safe distance, and are prepared to retract our anchor at any moment.\n\nWe are collecting a sizable quantity of astral thread while we continue observations."

 astral_rift.710.name: "Bird's-Eye View"
 astral_rift.710.desc: "To gain a different perspective on our situation, we have prepared and released a drone to scout the surrounding area. After orbiting our vessel in concentric circles, we discovered a curved, black wall not far from our location.\n\nThe readings are somewhat puzzling, however, as the height of the wall always returns equal to the exact altitude of the drone. Observing this phenomenon has furthered our understanding of non-standard spacial dimensions."

 astral_rift.715.name: "A New Development"
 astral_rift.715.desc: "There is a new development.\n\nA new series of walls have appeared directly in front of us.\n\nWe are maintaining a safe distance lest one of these objects materialize straight through our §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§!.\n\nPerhaps by sampling their material we may further understand the current situation. Alternatively, we can take some time to map out the shapes of these walls and detect if there is any kind of pattern."

 astral_rift.720.desc: "We have extended a retrieval arm and gathered a sample of the dark material from the wall.\n\nWe were surprised to find that the sample maintained an infinite height as we pulled it free to analyze it. Its properties have much in common with an ink or paint, although the components of the pigment are of a type unknown. Some of the binding agents used in this ink are actually a unique form of dissolved crystals.\n\nAs an experiment, we drew a line using a small amount of the sample and waited. A short time later, a nearly identical mark appeared parallel to it.\n\nWe repeated this action several times, each with a different amount of the material, iterating through several different designs. Each time, the mark was reproduced exactly and in the same orientation.\n\nGiven these results, there is reason to believe that some sort of entity is making use of the material in an attempt to communicate. Accordingly, we have begun writing some basic phrases in binary using small dots and dashes. These were copied exactly, but there was also something new: next to each of our words appeared a pattern.\n\nEach time we drew the same phrase, the same pattern appeared. Is this a translation?"

 astral_rift.725.desc: "It has taken a few days, but we have completed mapping the strange objects within this white space.\n\nWhile to us they appear as a series of walls and columns, the Sphere's computer was able to calculate how they would look from above.\n\nThe patterns and spaces indicate a clearly deliberate structure and consistency. The results are conclusive: the structures form written characters in a language unknown to us.\n\nThough we are unable to understand it, the Sphere's computer has been dedicated to deciphering everything we've recorded. During that time, something interesting happened.\n\nCircular columns identical to the diameter of our vessel began appearing in the space nearby.\n\nWe propelled ourselves to a safe distance, only to find that a solid wall was being raised in our wake. There appeared to be no danger however, as the wall stopped as soon as we did.\n\nSomething was 'painting' a trail behind us.\n\nHaving analyzed the symbols, we are confident that one of them translates into a greeting, or simply put: §E"Hello."§!"
