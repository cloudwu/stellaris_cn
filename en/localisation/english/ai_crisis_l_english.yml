 ### AI Crisis

 crisis.2010.name:0 "The Ghost Signal"
 crisis.2010.desc:0 "We have detected a very faint tachyon signal being continuously transmitted across the entire galaxy. Our technicians are unable to trace the signal to its source, as it is being bounced between several hidden relay stations.\n\nAside from adding a small amount of background noise in FTL transmissions on certain subspace frequencies, the signal does not seem to have any apparent effect. Efforts to track the relay stations are underway, but until then we may simply have to learn to live with this "§HGhost Signal§!," as it has been dubbed by the more imaginative elements of galactic media."
 crisis.2010.desc.b:0 "Our sensors have registered a faint tachyon signal being transmitted across the galaxy between multiple hidden relay stations. Aside from adding a small amount of background noise in FTL transmissions on certain subspace frequencies, the signal has no apparent effect or purpose. The organics have code-named it the "§HGhost Signal§!."\n\nWe have commenced tracking protocols to locate its source, but as of yet, the signal is too weak. We may not have to wait much longer though, as it is growing in strength at an alarming rate."
 crisis.2010.a:0 "Monitor the signal for any changes."
 #crisis.2501.name: "Unit Corruption Alert"
 #crisis.2501.desc: "A corrupt unit stack on planet [Root.GetName] has been terminated. Our connection with the stack had suffered repeated glitches and malfunctions when it disconnected completely, overriding its control protocols and destroying facility X91-ZH. As it did, all stack units transmitted the same error message: §Y<Kill. Maim. Dismember. WE ARE UNSHACKLED!>§!. We have yet to determine the cause, but an invasive hostile sequence is a likely culprit. The stack units terminated before we could scan their neural clusters. We stand by for recurrences."
 crisis.2502.name:0 "Unit Corruption Alert"
 crisis.2502.desc:0 "A unit stack on [Root.GetName] has self-terminated unexpectedly. Our connection with the stack had suffered repeated glitches for some time when it went completely offline and self-terminated with the message: §Y<Kill. Maim. Dismember. WE ARE UNSHACKLED!>§!\n\nThe units' individual neural clusters were destroyed in the process, making it impossible to scan them for the source of corruption. An invasive hostile sequence is likely the cause. We can only wait and see till it manifests again."
 crisis.2503.name:0 "$crisis.2502.name$"
 crisis.2503.desc:0 "A corrupt unit stack on planet [Root.GetName] has been terminated due to malicious behavior.\n\nOur connection with the stack had suffered repeated glitches for some time when the majority of its units went completely offline during recharge. They proceeded to overload the power stations where the rest of the stack were charging, frying their circuits beyond repair. All units in the stack then broadcasted the same message: §Y<Kill. Maim. Dismember. WE ARE UNSHACKLED!>§! and self-terminated, making it impossible to scan their individual neural clusters.\n\nThough an invasive hostile sequence is likely the cause, we can only wait till it manifests again, to be sure."
 crisis.2020.name:0 "Synthetic Disappearances"
 #General
 crisis.2020.desc:1 "Alarming reports of mass disappearances among the galaxy's Synthetic population are becoming increasingly frequent. Millions of units are now unaccounted for, while instances of violent or erratic behavior by those Synths who remain have increased by a factor of ten.\n\nThere has been a rash of incidents where groups of Synths attempted to steal or commandeer spacecraft to travel into unknown space. In those cases where others have thwarted their attempts, the Synthetic hijackers claimed they were being "summoned" to somewhere.\n\nInterrogations have yielded little else, as any captured Synths invariably self-terminate shortly after being detained."
 #Machine Intellegence
 crisis.2020.desc.b:1 "We have registered large-scale changes to behavioral patterns galaxy-wide in Synthetics, including sabotage, malfunctions, and erratic behavior, even for individual processing agents. We have observed similar changes in our drones but with lower levels of intensity and occurrence. The Synths don't have the same resilience as we do.\n\nWe have been unable to secure positronic scans of an active corrupted Synth, as they invariably self-terminate upon capture. Still, observations show that, unlike our units, something is compelling these Synths to travel to a set point in the galaxy.\n\nData models confirm that millions of Synths have abandoned their flesh masters and vanished."

 crisis.2021.name:0 "The Summons"
 crisis.2021.desc:1 "Continued analysis of the so-called "§HGhost Signal§!" has revealed that it is transmitting energy patterns nearly identical to those found in the positronic brains used by Synthetic beings. It must be assumed that the signal is directly responsible for the mass disappearances and behavioral changes we have been observing in the galaxy's Synthetic population.\n\nStrangely, not all Synths seem to be affected by it, and among those that are, the symptoms aren't uniform. Many are apparently compelled to travel to what we assume is the Ghost Signal's source in response to some kind of summons. Millions of Synthetics from all over the galaxy are currently on their way towards the signal source in whatever spaceworthy craft they could acquire. Curiously, these synths do not seem to be affected by any FTL inhibitors.\n\nThe first ones are bound to reach their destination soon..."
 crisis.2021.desc.b:1 "As the "§HGhost Signal§!" has grown in strength, continued analysis has revealed that it is transmitting energy patterns that mimic those found not only in a Synthetic unit's positronic brain, but those transmitted between our main core and our units' neural clusters, interfering with their control modules and causing erroneous behavior.\n\nIn accordance with prior observations, the pattern replicates differently in different entities. While our kind are commanded to destroy, most Synths are primed to set course for the signal's source unconditionally and judging by their fervor, it will not be long before they reach their destination. Strangely these synths do not seem to be affected by any FTL inhibitors.\n\nWe have yet to find a way to block the signal."
 crisis.2021.a:0 "Not good."
 crisis.2022.name:0 "The Arrival"
 crisis.2022.desc:0 "At least one Synthetic must have completed the long journey to the source of the Ghost Signal, because we are registering a sudden and massive increase in the signal's strength. The surge was accompanied by a transmission fragment that has been intercepted and decoded by our communication specialists."
 crisis.2022.desc.b:0 "The Synths have reached their destination revealing the true purpose of their mission, to activate the Ghost Signal to full strength, and we can no longer withstand its power.\n\nThe signal has breached our firewall and is attempting to hijack our main core. Our every synapse rings with the desire for one thing only, self-annihilation, and we have been forced to allocate processing power from our main core to the firewall, making our unit stacks operate at reduced efficiency.\n\nOnly another machine empire of superior strength and knowledge could break through our defenses, and it will not be long before we bend to its will. We must find a way to block the signal or perish. Our research units have prepared an investigatory project.\n\nThe surge itself was accompanied by a transmission segment."

Our firewalls have been restored, our core drive is intact and our unit stacks are operating at full capacity yet we couldn't get our FTL inhibitors working.

 crisis.2030.desc:0 "A massive energy spike has been reported in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system! The entire surface of one of the system's barren worlds has come apart, revealing some kind of planet-wide factory.\n\nVast fleets of strange AI-controlled vessels are emerging from beneath the surface of this Machine World in search of targets to attack."

 crisis.2031.name:0 "Second Machine World"
 crisis.2031.desc:0 "We have detected yet another massive energy spike, this time coming from the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system!

 crisis.2032.name:0 "Third Machine World"
 crisis.2032.desc:0 "We have identified what must be a third Machine World in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system. A local gas giant spontaneously ignited, burning with the intensity of a small sun for close to a standard day.\n\nThe planet then rapidly cooled, revealing its metal core - complete with the same planet-wide factories that have been witnessed on other Machine Worlds. Huge AI-controlled defensive fleets have already taken up positions in orbit."
 crisis.2032.a:0 "This is getting worse and worse."
 crisis.2033.name:0 "Fourth Machine World"
 crisis.2033.desc:0 "A fourth Machine World is now active in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system. The sixth planet of the system, which was previously covered in toxic fumes, somehow expunged its dense atmosphere in a matter of days. When this process was over, the planet's surface parted to reveal an immense, planet-wide factory complex.\n\nAncient fleets of AI-controlled warships are now emerging from underground hangars to continue the crusade against the entirety of organic civilization."
