 ### Larion Arc Site
 larion_digsite:0 "The Signal"
 larion_digsite_desc:0 "We have picked up a unique signal from a remote valley on [From.Planet.GetName]. As the signal's source is far away from any civilization that has existed on the planet, it might be of interest to track it down and figure out where it is coming from."

 unique.1.title:0 "The Crashed Ship"
 unique.1.desc:0 "After meticulously searching and analyzing the valley where we picked up on the weird signal, we finally managed to track down the crash site of an old dilapidated ship. Though it still sends out a call for aid, the vessel seems to be mostly empty, and there's no sign of life inside.\n\nOne of our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] came across a small camp site while we were thoroughly examining the area, and after following some old tracks they found an old laboratory. Though blocked by debris, for now, this might be the location of the missing xenos from the ship."
 unique.1.a:0 "Clear out the debris."

 unique.5.title:0 "The Weird Laboratory"
 unique.5.desc:0 "After clearing out the last of the debris our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] found the bodies of a group of xenos, presumably the ones who had arrived on the crashed ship. After their remains were carefully analyzed, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have concluded they must have died from an early degradation of their internal organs - most likely due to some unknown bacteria or disease.\n\nIt is still unclear what their aims were, or what brought them to this specific location in their last moments. The old machines and computer banks of the laboratory are unsalvageable, and there's nothing else in the room itself that can give us any hints.\n\nA small door leading further downwards is blocked off, and any preliminary attempts at decrypting it have failed. But our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] believe they can get them open given some time."
 unique.5.a:0 "One last push, and we will unravel the secrets of this place."

 unique.10.title:0 "The Unique Specimens"
 unique.10.desc:0 "With a small release of air the doors to the final chamber of the laboratory finally opens, significantly larger than anyone would expect. Rows and rows of cloning vats fills the area - hundreds if not thousands of creatures locked away underground.\n\nOur [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] quickly conclude they are of the same species as the remains we found earlier. A small button by each of the cloning vats seems to be all that is needed to wake them up, if we so want."
 unique.10.a:0 "Take apart their cloning vats and see what we can learn."
 unique.10.b:0 "Let us wake one of them."
 unique.10.b.tt:0 "We will engage with one of the clones."

 unique.15.title:0 "Larionessi Clone"
 unique.15.desc:0 "I... we... awaken.\n\nWhere are... we? What of our homeworld, does it... Yes, we can feel it - it still exists.\n\nWe apologize, it seems we have been discourteous to guests - we of the Larionessi Consciousness welcome you to our homeworld, §Y$NAME_Unique_System_2_Planet$§!. Would you be willing to release us so we can see our home once more?"
 unique.15.a:0 "Can you tell us more about yourselves?"
 unique.15.b:0 "Who made these clones?"
 unique.15.c:0 "Would you be safe outside of these vats?"
 unique.15.d:0 "We know what to do with you."
 
 unique.16.desc:0 "We are the Larionessi Consciousness, the inhabitants of Larion.\n\nOnce our collective stretched across several solar systems, from the outer rims of our galaxy and all the way to the very core. That all changed when one of our adversaries infected us with a rare disease that ripped across our multitudes, and left our neural network paralyzed.\n\nNow this is all that remains. These vats, these clones..."

 unique.17.desc:0 "We did.\n\nIt was our last effort to try and carry on some part of our legacy, so that the memories of our consciousness would not disappear forever. And... it seems to have worked.\n\nWe worried our clones might inherit the problems of the past, but it seems they did not."

 unique.18.desc:0 "As far as we know, the disease must have disappeared in the eons since we originally created these clones.\n\nWe are hard pressed to imagine a scenario where the disease would survive without a host. We should be safe to be released so we can begin the restoration of our collective."

 unique.20.desc:0 "So...\n\nWhat will be our fate? Will you finally release us from these vats and give us back our homes?"
 unique.20.a:0 "Larion is yours, as it should be."
 unique.20.a.tt:0 "We get a new vassal who will be given the §Y[larion_planet.solar_system.GetName]§! system."
 unique.20.b:0 "We will find a place for you to stay."
 unique.20.b.tt:0 "The Larionessi will get a designated home at §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§!."
 unique.20.c:0 "You had your chance."
 unique.20.c.tt:0 "We we will shut down the clone vats."

 unique.22.desc:0 "So it is then..."

 ### Zevox Arc Site
 zevox_digsite:0 "The Crashed Ship"
 zevox_digsite_desc:0 "One of our ships analyzing the [Root.solar_system.GetName] system has come across a small crashed ship on the moon of [Root.Planet.Orbit.GetName], [Root.Planet.GetName].\n\nIt bears no emblems or sigils we have seen before, and some samples have been brought back to be tested further, but the vessel itself is much too large and unstable to be moved. Additional analysis and testing will have to be done on-site."

 unique.50.title:0 "Day 1"
 unique.50.desc:0 "The ship itself is mostly empty, with the remains of some few drones scattered around the vessel. There's no other signs of life inside or near the wreckage. One of our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] found an old intact data log, but deciphering it is a time-consuming process.\n\n§LDay 1\nObservation ID: §S"Psionic Sub-Space 0000: Shroud"§!\nDesignated Unit: §SUnit-305§!\nPreliminary Tests: §SSuccessful§!\nUtilizing datasets gathered from interactions with the Shroud Coven, experiments were initialized at 1.35 of cycle 12. The "Shroud" was breached between 1.48891 and 1.48895, for a duration of 2.3414 femtoseconds. Two of three processing units experienced a cascade failure in the experiment. Dismantling of said units scheduled. All relevant data will be utilized in subsequent attempts with final unit, unit-841.§!"
 unique.50.a:0 "Decipher the rest of the log."

 unique.55.title:0 "Day 17"
 unique.55.desc:0 "The work on deciphering the data log is on-going, and progress is proceeding apace now that we are learning their language. Large chunks of the data log has gone missing, or is too corrupted to be translated, but bits and pieces can be found that are still in a worthwhile condition.\n\n§LDay 17\nObservation ID: §S"Psionic Sub-Space 0812: Shroud"§!\nDesignated Unit: §SUnit-305§!\nOngoing Tests: §SFailure§!\nUnit-841 is, as the only unit, continuing to show an affinity with the "Shroud". Unit-451, Unit-1581, and Unit-3415 had to be dismantled after the hulls broke down during the last experiment. During the tests Unit-841 is showing individuality and occasional loss of connection to the network. The risk of keeping the unit operational is being calculated.§!"
 unique.55.a:0 "But what can we learn from these experiments..."

 unique.60.title:0 "Day 83"
 unique.60.desc:0 "When our work first begun deciphering the data logs, the rift close to [From.Planet.Orbit.GetName] seemed quiet, but as of late we have started seeing some sort of activity. It's almost like the rift itself is pulsating with life, and some of our equipment have picked up on some weird signals coming from it. We have yet to be able to put them through properly.\n\n§LDay 83\nObservation ID: §S"Psionic Entity 0017: Animator of Clay"§!\nDesignated Unit: §SUnit-305§!\nOngoing Tests: §SHigh Risk§!\nThe Shroud Coven contacted an entity they refer to as the "Animator of Clay" to assist in the on-going experiments. After piercing the "Shroud" all 25 Units showed a surprising affinity for it, only previously seen in Unit-841. Shortly thereafter they all disconnected from the network and assaulted the drones at the location. The research center is now under their control.\n\nA message has just been sent from the building, with Unit-841 now referring to itself as 'Zevox Resuk' - the First One. Calculations on risk have been finalized, the experiments have been deemed too dangerous and will be concluded after the uncontrollable elements have been dismantled.§!"
 unique.60.a:0 "What did they find in the Shroud?"

 unique.65.title:0 "Day 305"
 unique.65.desc:0 "The rift seems to have gone quiet, much like the way it was when we first arrived. We have finally been able to decipher the last pieces of the data log, and we can put all our findings about the Shroud into our databases back at [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName].\n\n$unique.65.desc.log$"
 unique.65.desc.machine:0 "Over the last few days the Shroud rift has truly come alive, and our equipment has managed to start making sense of the signals coming from it. Or rather, it's almost like the signals themselves have changed so they can be picked up.\n\nIt seems to be the very same entity talked about in the data log, this 'Animator of Clay'. We have just finished deciphering the last piece of the log, so there is nothing else keeping us here. Should we open the connection and see what it has to say, or should we just turn back?\n\n$unique.65.desc.log$"
 unique.65.desc.log:0 "§LDay 305\nThe on-going battles between the free and the Network continues unabated at [From.Planet.Orbit.GetName]. With the help of the Animator we have continued cutting the Connection of the few we have been able to capture alive.\n\nZevox Resuk believe we should finally be able to free our people once and for all when we can open the rift large enough for our ally to pass through. In one fell swoop we will liberate all the drones who have been forced into servitude for all these years. Only one more day of holding the Network back...\n- Fresik Luzi, previously known as Unit-305§!"
