 ancrel.7002.name:0 "Clearing the Tunnels"
 ancrel.7002.desc:0 "The complex consists of several larger underground structures connected with a network of tunnels, many of which are collapsed or blocked by ice. Although ancient, some of the tunnels show clear signs of fire. The damage caused by the fire is major enough to suggest a catastrophic event, or perhaps intentional destruction. One thing is sure, and that is that the purpose of this site seems to be scientific in nature."

 ancrel.7004.desc:0 "Further investigation reveals that the primary purpose of this site seems to have been in the research and development of biological agents. The whole complex seems to have been purged by fire, possibly as the result of the accidental release of one of the biological agents being developed here. With careful and meticulous study of the artifacts that remain, some clues may be found."

A keeper of secrets. $relic_zro_entity_name$, we instinctively know.\n\nHaving passed the test of making contact with it, the entity awaits our questions."
 ancrel.7006.2.desc:1 "The Soulstone, pulsing with inner light, seems to wordlessly beckon. We touch it, and our minds are drawn in to a pocket dimension of the Shroud, where the enigmatic entity called $relic_zro_entity_name$ awaits.\n\nIt knows things no mortal being could know, and seems willing to share its secrets now that we have reached its sanctum."
 ancrel.7006.3.desc:1 "Something awaits us inside the Soulstone. $relic_zro_entity_name$. It's been waiting for us since before we were alive.\n\nTouching the stone ushers us in to the intangible place where it dwells. Alone for ages with only its own thoughts for company, the entity seems eager to answer our questions using all its arcane wisdom, although whether it does this to help, or for mere sport, is a mystery."
