 origin_riftworld: "Riftworld"
 origin_riftworld_desc: "A massive rift in space and time looms near this civilization's homeworld. After studying the phenomenon for millennia, recent advances in starship technology will allow them to finally reach out and discover what secrets it might hold."
 origin_tooltip_riftworld_effects: "- Homeworld: ['concept_riftworld_digsite'] ['concept_archaeology_site'] $NEW_LINE$- Chance for [ 'concept_astral_rift', $ASTRAL_RIFTS$ ] to appear in systems you control: §G+100%§!"
 START_SCREEN_RIFTWORLD: "For as long as we can remember, the Great Rift has loomed in the skies above [GetHomeWorldName]. Legends propose that our past is intimately entwined with this mysterious celestial scar and an ancient impact site near our capital.\n\nFor generations, the site was revered, but little understood. However, recent seismic activity has uncovered subsurface anomalies in the crater. Preparations are already underway to drill into its core. Opinions remain divided on what we may uncover there.\n\nIs it simple coincidence that this has occurred at the advent of Hyperdrive technology? Just as we reach for the heavens, our attention is pulled back to the ground. Perhaps what what lies beneath the surface of this world is meant to aid us on our journey to the stars. Perhaps it can prepare us for whatever lies beyond the Rift."

 astral_planes.2105.name: "Strange Transmission"
 astral_planes.2105.desc: "In the aftermath of the exploration of the Astral Rift in §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§!, a mysterious transmission was received.\n\nOur scientists have determined its origin to be from beyond the rift itself, and have only been able to translate a few words."

 astral_planes.2110.name: "$astral_planes.2105.name$"
 astral_planes.2110.desc: "...attune... with the planes... we will find you..."

 astral_planes.2120.name: "Seismic Anomaly Detected"
 astral_planes.2120.desc: "Recent seismic activity has revealed unexpected features of the ancient impact site near our capital.\n\nThis specific crater has been linked to legends involving the very genesis of our species."

 riftworld_digsite: "Ancient Crater"
 riftworld_digsite_desc: "We've detected anomalous seismic activity from deep inside an ancient crater on the surface of [Planet.GetName]. Underground sonar revealed a previously unknown cavity."
 astral_planes.2125.name: "High Speed Impact"
 astral_planes.2125.desc: "Initial excavations into the base of the crater revealed a fully-formed cylinder of impactite lodged deep into the earth.\n\nThis vein must have originated from a meteoric impact of extremely high velocity. Initial calculations demonstrate the object must have arrived at nearly the speed of light."
 astral_planes.2125.a: "Continue excavations."
 astral_planes.2130.name: "Underground Caverns"
 astral_planes.2130.desc: "At the termination point of the impactite vein, we have discovered an expansive cave system.\n\nPools of underground water support thin lines of pale vegetation along the cavern walls. At the bottom of one of these pools lies the remnants of an anomalous spherical object. It is not a natural formation, and appears to be the source of this impact site."
 astral_planes.2130.a: "Recover the object."
 astral_planes.2135.name: "Ancient Sphere"
 astral_planes.2135.desc: "We have recovered the sphere from the underground lake.\n\nWhile covered in vegetative growth, much of it remains fully intact. Its construction is a strange mix of highly sophisticated design and crude assembly. Perfectly smooth metallic plates cover the frontal portion of the ship, which must have reduced friction significantly upon atmospheric entry.\n\nThe trajectory of its resting site aligns with the vein of impactite, confirming that this sphere is the source of the metamorphic rock that led us here. Even more incredibly, there are signs that this vessel had passengers."
 astral_planes.2140.name: "Ancestors"
 astral_planes.2140.desc.common: "We have recovered a cache of documents from within the ancient sphere, each written in an archaic version of our own language. Several of these mention names associated with our most sacred legends.\n\nAn intricate network of ladders snakes upward from the impact site to a massive tunnel system. Based on the varying ages of the rope fibers, these caverns must have been occupied for several generations as the crash survivors worked their way toward the surface.\n\nHowever, nothing we'd discovered thus far could have prepared us for the final revelation: one of the upper chambers contained a burial site. DNA analysis conducted on the remains within revealed a shocking truth: these people are our ancestors.\n\nWhere exactly they came from, or why this place was forgotten, is yet unknown. The salvaged documents are in a poorly preserved state, but we have recovered a data log from the sphere. It clearly shows that the vessel arrived in our star system by means of the Astral Rift near [from.planet.GetName]."
 astral_planes.2140.desc.has_rift_sphere: "$astral_planes.2140.desc.common$\n\nWhile clearly less advanced than our own tech, this sphere is a testament to its builders desperation and ingenuity. This was a final effort to escape what must have been a terrible fate on the far side of the rift."
 astral_planes.2140.desc.default: "$astral_planes.2140.desc.common$\n\nWith some study, we should be able to replicate and even improve upon the technology required to construct a vessel with these dimension-spanning capabilities."

At each stage of progress, you may be prompted with orders to give our Scientists that will lead to varying, sometimes unexpected results. Most expeditions beyond Astral Rifts have multiple paths to follow.\n\nTo unravel the secrets of a Rift, a Scientist must make a §SBreakthrough§! to advance through each of the Rift's stages. Scientists with relevant §STraits and higher Skill§! speed the process of advancing to the next stage, while a higher Difficulty rating of a path choice will slow it. Any Scientist who investigates a Rift for long enough will amass §SClues§! which will make a Breakthrough more likely.\n\nWhile exploring an §SAstral Rift§!, Scientists are tethered into another dimension and cannot be removed until the exploration is complete. As a consequence of being trapped between time and space in this fashion, they cannot die from old age."
