 astral_rift.1000.name: "Understanding"
 astral_rift.1000.desc: "Something on the far side of the Rift has taken hold of the Sphere and disabled our retraction device.\n\nThe first parcels of data we received were unintelligible, but subsequent transfers are slowly piecing these messages together. We speculate the flow of time is much faster on the other side of this rift, and we are in fact receiving communication in real-time from across the breach.\n\nThe result is the processing of approximately one word per day. The following report is what we have received so far.\n\n§E"we observe..."§!\n\n§E"apology... method... unkind..."§!\n\n§E"emergency..."§!\n\n§E"understand..."§!\n\nThese brief messages are hidden amongst heavy noise and incomprehensible data.\n\nWho knows what danger the [Explorer.GetCrew] of the §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§! is in.\n\nIt may be possible to re-establish contact and regain control by sending an electromagnetic pulse through the anchor cord in an effort to reset our control systems."

 astral_rift.1005.name: "Home"
 astral_rift.1005.desc.common: "A projection of our galaxy could be pieced together from the images, along with a second image of a much smaller, yet unusually dense system. Between the two, there stretched a series of Astral Rifts. We understood that this was a roadmap from our dimension to somewhere else.\n\nA small point of light was abnormally highlighted inside the image of our galaxy. Later analysis confirmed this was our Homeworld, [Explorer.GetHomeWorldName], shining brightly. A similar light was discovered to be marked in the neighboring universe.\n\nThey are showing us where to go.\n\nWe're receiving more data than our computers can reasonably handle before it becomes corrupted or lost. We should prioritize the type of information we'd like to preserve."
 astral_rift.1005.desc: "The next two words we were able to decode were §E"home"§! and §E"witness"§!. Amazingly, as our understanding of the alien data improves, we also discovered the existence of visual data embedded within the noise.\n\n$astral_rift.1005.desc.common$"

 astral_rift.1010.desc.common.2: "With sensors fully operational, the crew observed a gaseous entity directly nearby their location; presumably this is what had been controlling the vessel. It seemed that the jolt of energy has incapacitated it, at least for the time being.\n\nThe Sphere is being held in some sort of pocket dimension. We are surrounded on all sides by the swirling clouds of a dense nebula. The only other entity detected is the creature nearby.\n\nAfter recovering from the shock, it has begun to bombard the Sphere with a series of rapid communications and signals.\n\nOur computers and sensors have become overloaded with information, making navigation difficult. We will need some computational support to understand what we are receiving.\n\nIt is not clear that we are welcome here."

 astral_rift.1015.name: "Ascendance"
 astral_rift.1015.desc: "More images.\n\nA chronicle of this alien homeworld was shown to us in great detail.\n\nThese beings formed millennia ago by a chance combination of gasses and energy that accumulated nearby a massive Astral Rift. They flow freely in and out of their planet as if they were part of its atmosphere.\n\nAt the end of each life cycle, their essence disperses back into the planet and gets born anew. Cities in the sky rose, fell, and rose again. Civilizations formed on top of previous civilizations with the knowledge physically maintained by these ancestral particles. The degree of the time passing was safely estimated to be magnitudes greater than the history of our known universe.\n\nIn the end, we behold a civilization of awakened higher beings. Their physiology alone is more advanced than any technology we could conceive.\n\nWe have logged this new species in our databases as the Formless.\n\n§E"flourishing..."§!\n\nOnce again, we're receiving more data than our computers can reasonably handle before it becomes corrupted or lost. We should prioritize the type of information we'd like to preserve."
 astral_rift.1015.a: "Preserve the physics data."
 astral_rift.1015.b: "Preserve the society data."

 astral_rift.1020.name: "Shatter"
 astral_rift.1020.desc: "Their gaseous homeworld was revealed to us in more and more detail. This time, we see its individual inhabitants. Beings of light, gas, and astral material leaked from the nearby rift are living in what could easily be described as a utopia.\n\nEventually, a great structure was raised. An incredible piece of engineering, it stretched directly from their planet into the rift, allowing them to easily travel between this dimension and countless others. With such an astral conduit existing for so long between the planes, they have shaped many rifts to fit their specific needs. Their society stretched between a multitude of dimensions, colonizing entire universes as we would new planets.\n\nHowever, their greatest achievement was also their greatest disaster. Their empire spread further than the astral conduit could maintain. Brighter and brighter the megastructure grew until the sight of it was difficult to look upon without shielding one's eyes, until it finally burst violently in a dimension-spanning explosion that fractured their civilization.\n\n§E"shattered kin..."§!\n\n§E"war..."§!\n\n§E"help us..."§!\n\nOur §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§! has been forcibly ejected from the Rift. A dimensional portal is now opening in the [solar_system.GetName] System."
 astral_rift.1020.a: "We've opened a doorway..."
 astral_rift.1020.b: "Seal it! Quickly!"

 astral_rift.1025.name: "Escape"
 astral_rift.1025.desc: "With our systems re-enabled, we've retracted the anchor cable and escaped from the creature inside of the Crystal Rift.\n\nIt is unknown what further powers of manipulation they would have deployed on us, and it is best not to find out.\n\nOn a fortunate note, the residue it left on the hull of our vessel is extremely dense with astral material."

 astral_rift.1030.name: "The Seal"
 astral_rift.1030.desc: "A gateway was nearly established in our capital system that placed our people in great danger.\n\nLuckily, with technology we have gained from studying Astral Rifts, we were able to successfully seal this danger permanently.\n\nWhatever was seeking to come through will remain a mystery.\n\nOur people consider this a great victory over an unfathomably powerful enemy."

 astral_rift_lonely_planet: "Hatching Ground"

 astral_rift.1100.name: "Giant Eggs"
 astral_rift.1100.desc: "The large rocks our probe detected are actually eggs!\n\nThe planet is a giant hatchery. Judging by their twitching, the eggs will soon hatch and this place will be host to a multitude of alien young. We have not detected any creature that could have laid these. With each egg the size of our §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§!, it does not seem likely that we could miss a full grown adult. Neither does this planet have the proper ecosystem to support a such large population.\n\nOur preliminary theories are that this species conducts interstellar migration, or that their life cycle ends swiftly after they lay their eggs in order to give the environment time to recover."

 astral_rift.1105.name: "Star Drinkers"
 astral_rift.1105.desc: "The eggs are hatching.\n\nThe landscape is overrun with massive, winged animals emerging from the shells. Within minutes, they gain the ability to fly. The skies are now filled with these soaring creatures.\n\nStrangely, we have yet to witness them feed on any other organism. Their instinctive behavior of flying high into the atmosphere suggests that they might be gaining energy from the planet's star. The movement of the creature's fin-like wings is similar to the way one would maneuver a sail, spread to maximize exposure to stellar radiation in order to direct their travel.\n\nThere is still much we do not understand about these creatures. Studying them more closely could give us a better understanding of their physiology. That said, given our lack of knowledge, observing them from a distance might be safer."
 astral_rift.1105.a: "Get closer."
 astral_rift.1105.b: "Keep your distance."

 astral_rift.1110.name: "Friendly Hatchlings"
 astral_rift.1110.desc: "The creatures showed no fear as we approached them, probably due to a lack of predators within their isolated habitat.\n\nWe were able to easily take samples from the beings and the remains of their eggs as they flew curiously around us. Their skin forms a natural solar panel that allows them to gain all necessary sustenance from their star. It is also so highly resistant to pressure that it would comfortably withstand the vacuum of space for long periods of time. It is highly likely that these creatures have evolved to be capable of prolonged space flight."
 astral_rift.1110.a: "Remarkable."

 astral_rift.1115.name: "Solar Sailing"
 astral_rift.1115.desc: "Watching the behavioral flight of these young creatures is illuminating.\n\nTheir instinctive understanding of how to manipulate their solar sails is masterful, allowing for great speeds and tight turns as they play together in the upper atmosphere.\n\nThese beings fly as nimbly through space as through the air, engaging in darting maneuvers with little regard for how far the planet is left behind. However, the evolutionary forces behind such stunning adaptation remain unclear."
 astral_rift.1115.a: "Impressive."

 astral_rift.1120.name: "Astral Migration"
 astral_rift.1120.desc: "Our research was interrupted by a disturbance in the fabric of space.\n\nA being larger than a battleship suddenly phased into existence. It was immediately surrounded by darting (and seemingly playful) hatchlings. Given the larger creature's physiological similarity, it is reasonable to assume this is a mature version of the species.\n\nIt seems that this secluded planet serves as a safe nesting area for a species that has evolved to migrate across dimensions. Even as we watched, the adult herded the young toward toward a newly formed rift in the upper atmosphere.\n\nTheir passage left a rippling wake of spatial disruption, as well as a large concentration of $astral_threads$."
 astral_rift.1120.a: "A remarkable lifeform."

 astral_rift.1125.name: "Astral Spawning"
 astral_rift.1125.desc: "Our research was interrupted by a disturbance in the fabric of space.\n\nA being larger than a battleship suddenly phased into existence. It was immediately surrounded by darting (and seemingly playful) hatchlings. Given the larger creature's physiologically similarity, it is reasonable to assume this is a mature version of the species.\n\nInitially wary of our presence, it was reassured by the friendliness of the young who continue to frolic around our vessel without care.\n\nThe creature lingered for a few hours, before a new rift in space appeared in the outer atmosphere. Wrangling together its charges, the adult guided them inside and passed into another dimension.\n\nThe wake of their passage left behind waves of spatial disruption, resulting in a large concentration of $astral_threads$."

 astral_rift_microverse: "The Microverse"

 astral_rift.1200.name: "Acceleration"
 astral_rift.1200.desc: "As our Sphere passed through the rift, we experienced a wild burst of acceleration.\n\nThe tremendous gravity of this universe was pulling us in. After an uncomfortable and dangerous ride, we found ourselves floating within a dense cluster of star systems, every one of which was within range of our Sphere's limited sensors. As far as we can tell, these comprise the totality of this universe.\n\nInitial reports also indicate high levels of dark matter; what's more, this mass is constantly increasing. As a direct consequence, the forces of gravity are intensifying over time."

 astral_rift.1205.name: "Shrinking Space"
 astral_rift.1205.desc: "This universe is shrinking in size. In due time, we predict it will completely collapse into itself.\n\nThe problem is that we cannot accurately calculate when this will occur. The Sphere's systems have been acting strangely since we arrived, and various data points have disappeared from the computer core. It is as if the data itself has been unwritten.\n\nElsewhere, a potted plant was observed lifting its roots and returning to a seed. The flow of time is clearly unstable here."

 astral_rift.1210.name: "Temporal Leak"
 astral_rift.1210.desc.common: "Outside of the Sphere the consequences are even more dramatic: the trajectory of asteroids have completely reversed, planets are dispersing into dust and gas, entire systems are condensing into balls of volatile material. Time is clearly flowing backward, and we are caught somewhere in between.\n\nEventually, the time will reach "zero" and this universe will be reduced to the size of a pin.\n\nAlthough we appear to be somewhat isolated from the time effects, the Sphere is obviously permeable. By synchronizing our computer with the [Fleet.GetName] outside the rift, we should be able to preserve the rapidly disappearing data. As a more drastic measure, we could use the unique properties of astral thread to repolarize the hull and seal the temporal leak."
 astral_rift.1210.desc.default: "Shrinking plants and lost data were only the start of our issues. The trouble has spread to the memory of the crew, with many appearing confused, forgetting what they were working on, or even that they entered the rift at all.\n\n$astral_rift.1210.desc.common$"
 astral_rift.1210.desc.gestalt: "Shrinking plants and lost data were only the start of our issues. The drones on the far side of the rift are experiencing something unusual. Our collective experience is growing confused, and we are finding it increasingly difficult to synchronize.\n\n$astral_rift.1210.desc.common$"

 astral_rift.1210.b: "Repolarize the hull."

 astral_rift.1215.name: "Emergency"
 astral_rift.1215.desc: "The [fleet.ship.GetName] was prompt to respond; we are now sending updates at regular intervals. This has successfully preserved the data we've collected thus far.\n\nUnfortunately, we're still exposed to the anomalous temporal flow, and the effects are getting stronger...\n\nWith significant and accelerating signs of de-aging in our crew, we are tactically retreating from this universe before it is too late."

 astral_rift.1220.name: "Unbirthing"
 astral_rift.1220.desc: "The §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§!'s hull has been successfully repolarized. We are now well isolated from the most extreme effects of the time dilation. Our thought patterns have returned to normal and we are able to continue the mission.\n\nWe are now prepared to study the unique physics of this universe more fully.\n\nWe could navigate closer toward one of the stars for direct observation of its 'unbirthing.' On the other hand, the very edge of existence would be a perfect vantage point to watch the end of time."
 astral_rift.1220.a: "Approach the closest star system."
 astral_rift.1220.b: "Observe from the edge of the universe."

 astral_rift.1225.name: "Stardust"
 astral_rift.1225.desc.common: "We have approached a Class G star, which is slowly fading away. The gasses it normally emits have been retracting as its light weakens. It would take millions of years to observe this in our own universe. This is a unique opportunity to witness such an event within a reasonable span of time."

The physics data we have collected as a result is literally astronomical.\n\nHowever, lingering any further might prove a fatal mistake, and we are returning immediately."

 astral_rift.1235.name: "End of the Beginning"
 astral_rift.1235.desc: "The star is no more.\n\nWe have managed to record almost every moment of its creation, from end to beginning.

 astral_rift.1300.name: "The Fluid"
 astral_rift.1300.desc: "Our §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§! has arrived submerged inside of a viscous, reddish fluid. All around us drift large disc-shaped blobs of more solid matter, but we have avoided collision with them thus far. A solid wall of a semi-gelatinous material surrounds us on all sides. We glide along easily.\n\nThe rhythmic pulsing we sensed from within this rift is in sync with the harmonic frequency of the liquid around us. Every three seconds, we are pushed forward with a rush of pressure driving us deeper into the tubular system. Resisting the flow is quite difficult on our engines.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for sample collection, but the appropriate apparatus may impede our navigation in these twisting tunnels."
 astral_rift.1300.a: "Deploy sample collection rig."
 astral_rift.1300.b: "Proceed forward at ease."

 astral_rift.1305.name: "Snagged"
 astral_rift.1305.desc.common: "Some time after arriving within the rift, we came to an abrupt halt as the sample apparatus trawling behind us became lodged in a narrowing of the tunnel system.\n\nWe attempted to free ourselves with intermittent bursts of propulsion, but the strength of the current prevented us from making any meaningful progress."

 astral_rift.1305.b: "Use emergency gasses."

 astral_rift.1310.name: "The Chamber"
 astral_rift.1310.desc.common: "The laminar flow along the tunnel walls has kept us well centered in our journey. Several days have passed without much incident. The disc-shaped foreign bodies surrounding us are also caught within the flow; they gently drift and tumble past the Sphere.\n\nWe have witnessed no evidence of sentient life. In fact, our strongest supposition at this point is that we are inside of some unknown, massive super organism. If our presence has been noticed by any natural defenses, we have not yet witnessed it.\n\nWe now find ourselves in an enormous chamber. The walls are lined with veiny protrusions. The chamber walls regularly expand and contract, forcing millions of liters of fluid through a single exit.\n\nAs we held our position, we discovered a second entryway into the chamber. Trace amounts of crystalline matter are suspended in the fluid coming from this tunnel. The pressure of its flow is low enough that with some skillful navigating this orifice could be explored."
 astral_rift.1310.desc: "We have cut loose the sampling rig. We noticed the surrounding area around the apparatus seemed to slowly darken and became swollen over time.\n\n$astral_rift.1310.desc.common$"

Whoever, or whatever, is entombed inside once ruled an entire galaxy. Some of the earliest pictographs reveal the origin of this powerful being.\n\nRaised by a space-born race of leviathans, the two species developed a unique symbiosis. Forming a potent psionic bond, they conquered countless systems together.\n\nThere are other symbols which refer to a "curse". Attempting to open the object - or even approaching it too closely - may be dangerous."

 astral_rift.1915.desc.lava_hide: "To evade notice, we have dipped ourselves into the river of molten lava below us.\n\nThe protective coating we had applied as a precaution allowed us to survive long enough to emerge some distance away, hidden from the attention of the floating creatures.\n\n$astral_rift.1915.desc.common$"
 astral_rift.1915.desc.lava_escape: "The floating creatures were not prepared for our sudden maneuver.\n\nA burst of our engines pulled us free of their tendrils, propelling us quickly into the river of molten lava below. Clearly, they are not accustomed to their prey behaving in such a way.\n\nThe protective coating we had applied as a precaution allowed us to survive long enough to emerge some distance away, hidden from their attention.\n\n$astral_rift.1915.desc.common$"
 astral_rift.1915.a: "Decipher the runes."
 astral_rift.1915.b: "Destroy the obelisk."

 astral_rift.1920.name: "Retrieval"
 astral_rift.1920.desc: "We retrieved the anchor cable and escaped from this dangerous landscape.\n\nSeveral of the floating creatures latched on to our §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§! as we were pulled away. One of them even came back with us into our dimension, and promptly disintegrated into pure astral material.\n\nWe are harvesting its remains for further study."

 astral_rift.1925.name: "Names"
 astral_rift.1925.desc: "It is a list of names.\n\nTrillions and trillions of names cover this obelisk. Arranged in a complicated mathematical pattern, they shift and change as we observe them.\n\nThe facets of the obelisk are uniquely aligned, allowing each name to be precisely true to one of the alcoves along the wall.\n\nTouching any one name with a probe results in a corresponding chamber lighting up with dangerous amounts of energy and a pitiful wailing.\n\nUnfortunately, upon doing this we have attracted the attention of the floating creatures once more."
 astral_rift.1925.a: "Enough. Pull the emergency anchor."
 astral_rift.1925.b: "Destroy this infernal device."

 astral_rift.1930.name: "Shattered Obelisk"
 astral_rift.1930.desc: "The charges we strategically placed along the seams of the obsidian tower have sheared it completely in half.\n\nAs the upper portion of the obelisk slid away, a severe darkness filled the cavern. The floating creatures we noticed earlier lost their luminosity and fell to the ground with heavy, wet thumps.\n\nThe gates containing the chambers lining the walls swung open. Countless hordes of creatures poured forth from these holes into the closest tunnel systems. We have no idea where these tunnels lead, but at least they are now free.\n\nThe shattered material of the obelisk possesses unique and interesting properties. We have taken as much of it aboard as we can for further study."

 astral_rift.1935.name: "Failure"
 astral_rift.1935.desc: "We have lost contact with [Leader.GetName].\n\nUpon retrieval of the §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§!, we discovered it filled with smoke and ash. The bodies of the [Explorer.GetCrew] were not recovered.\n\nIt is likely they are lost forever beyond the rift."

 astral_rift.1940.name: "Ominous Visitor"
 astral_rift.1940.desc: "A molten being is requesting audience with us. They claim to be the owners of the black obelisk we destroyed exactly six years ago."

 astral_rift.1941.desc: "You know not what you have done.\n\nYou have mistakenly freed our wards. Balance must be restored, or there will be great consequences.\n\nEach year, for six years, you will offer us replacement prisoners from your planets. We shall offer a fair trade in return.\n\nShould you decline, we shall happily torment your people until the suffering is complete."
 astral_rift.1941.a: "Very well. Restore the Balance."
 astral_rift.1941.b: "Be gone."

 astral_rift.1950.name: "Return of our Scientist"
 astral_rift.1950.desc: "[from.GetName] [from.GetHasHave] returned from the $astral_rift_volcano$ Astral Rift... but not as we remember them.\n\nCarbon-samples indicate [from.GetHisHer] age is now over 600 years old."
 astral_rift.1950.a: "Monitor this individual closely."

 astral_rift.1955.name: "Sacrifice"
 astral_rift.1955.desc: "We have discovered a disturbing development.\n\n[from.GetName] has been secretly sending members of our population back through the $astral_rift_volcano$ Astral Rift.\n\nThey claim it is being done in an effort to "restore the balance.""
 astral_rift.1955.a: "Dispose of [from.GetHimHer]."
 astral_rift.1955.b: "Allow [from.GetHimHer] to continue."
