fractalized_entropy_category: "Fractalized Entropy"
fractalized_entropy_category_desc: "Sensors have picked up a strange object drifting through the asteroid field. Its origin is unknown, but its course is steady, suggesting it can be intercepted and examined."
infernals.3205.name: "Fractalized Entropy"
infernals.3205.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reported the discovery of a rigid, angular construct suspended in stable stellar orbit. Composed of an unknown material and marked by faceted planes reminiscent of crystalline structures, the object resisted all compositional analysis. It remained locked in a fixed orientation, perpetually facing its parent star, and withstood all attempts at manipulation or rotation.\n\nDuring a controlled experiment, the survey vessel subjected the object to a concentrated energy pulse. The construct fractured cleanly, splitting into two symmetrical halves, each of which reconfigured into a smaller replica of the original. Subsequent pulses produced identical outcomes: division, replication, and consistent miniaturization.\n\nEventually, a diffuse cloud of miniature constructs stabilized in orbit. Each fragment retained the precise alignment and geometry of the progenitor, and the swarm as a whole mirrored the original structure's silhouette.\n\nThe phenomenon remains entirely without precedent or explanation. All collected telemetry has been archived for further analysis."
infernals.3205.a: "Preserve and monitor the fragments."

# Archaeological Sites
from_the_ashes_site: "From The Ashes"
from_the_ashes_site_desc: "The surface of [Planet.GetName] is scorching hot, and hostile to biological life. Images of clearly artificial ruins have therefore caught the attention of [GetScientistPlural]. An archaeological investigation could reveal who was here, and what happened to them."
infernals.2700.name: "Forgotten Empire"
infernals.2700.desc: "While the ruins on [From.Planet.GetName] first appeared to be built of stone, excavation and analysis suggests that many of the structures in this lost city are made of a petrified organic material comparable to wood. No source for such materials exists on the planet today. Smaller artifacts are built of crude metals, glass, and similar petrified organics, and [GetScientistPlural] have also found fossils of native creatures that no longer exist. \n\nIt appears the civilization in question inhabited the planet at a time when its climate was much more temperate. Did they disappear long before the planet turned to its current state, or did they witness the violent transition in their final years?"
infernals.2705.name: "Witnesses of Demise"
infernals.2705.desc: "Excavation of the ruined city on [From.Planet.GetName] has revealed places of cultural importance, decorated with intricate patterns that may be a written language. Most excitingly, the dig teams have found an underground chamber full of shelves, each containing thin sheets of bronze etched with densely-packed script. Despite the inefficiency of bronze as a storage medium, this appears to be a communal archive of texts. \n\nTranslation attempts have begun as the archaeological teams continue to spread out through the city. The question of the final fate of these people remains open."
infernals.2710.name: "Incoming Doom"
infernals.2710.desc: "The team on [From.Planet.GetName] has encountered a somber catacomb. It consists of a network of dugout trenches, with mummified alien remains resting in cavities in the walls, stacked three or four individuals high. Burial goods give us a glimpse of their technological development, such as primitive firearms, simple glass telescopes, and complex textile embroidery. \n\nMany junctions within the catacomb are guarded by statues of extinct local fauna. These creatures have a round, domed shell, four squat legs, and a small blunt head. In better-preserved specimens, they are depicted hunching down, using their shell to protect them from flame-like carvings in the material above them. \n\nThe true meaning of this artwork may be lost to time, but it may depict this society's awareness of its impending, fiery doom. Further excavation of the ruins may clarify what they were experiencing."
infernals.2715.name: "Blazing Downfall"
infernals.2715.desc: "Extensive exploration of the ruined city on [From.Planet.GetName] proves that this civilization lived through the collapse of its ecosystem, and knew its final, fiery days were approaching. Paper-based records existed before hot volcanic ashfall forced them to switch to bronze tablets, and artistic depictions of animals hiding from flame record their attempts to reckon with their own end. \n\nThe excavation also uncovered a nearly perfect specimen of the catacomb guardian statues. The flames carved above it have an internal glow, making this a striking piece worthy of preservation. \n\nWe also found evidence of attempts to stop the volcanism. Roadways and broken carts demonstrate that the inhabitants transported rubble to the nearest volcanic caldera and dumped it in to try to plug the volcano. Unfortunately, they were unable to stop their fate. The planet is devoid of multicellular life today. \n\nThis history reminds us of the precarity of any civilization, should it encounter a problem more powerful than the tools it has at its disposal."
infernals.2715.a: "A tragic end."
infernals.2715.b: "We should learn from their mistakes."

inferno_temple_site: "Inferno Temple"
inferno_temple_site_desc: "Far from the population centers of [Planet.GetName], in a range of active volcanic mountains, an ancient temple lies in ruins and disrepair. Understanding its history may grant us further insights into the planet's local culture."
infernals.2720.name: "Ancient Signs"
infernals.2720.desc: "The temple itself is scarred by signs of battle, and there are ancient remains of the local sentient species in the soil. It seems the temple was torched and abandoned. Security teams have noted that the locals avoid this entire area, believing it to be cursed. \n\nThe fire temple's walls protected its contents, including many intricate frescos and carvings. These feature a recurring motif of a circle of twisted fire, with a dark gash down its center. In one depiction, a bipedal figure plucks out one of four such eyes and casts it upon the world, creating this central motif. We are designating it the Infernal Eye. \n\nFurther excavations will reveal what beliefs surrounded this strange figure."
infernals.2725.name: "Ocular Offerings"
infernals.2725.desc: "Excavations of the temple of the Infernal Eye show evidence of many sacrifices. Large circular pits with platforms in the center, mimicking the Infernal Eye and its pupil, lie filled with layers of ash and charcoal. Molecular analysis reveals that the ash and charcoal comes from animal tissue. \n\nWhether these sacrifices were of wild or domestic animals, or indeed of the locals themselves, cannot be determined. \n\nAgents have been dispatched to current population centers in search of corollary evidence, while our excavators search for more answers."
infernals.2725.a: "It's a mystery waiting to be solved!"
infernals.2725.b: "Send drones to solve that mystery."
infernals.2730.name: "Dark Practices"
infernals.2730.desc: "A heavy stone doorway was discovered blocking off the deepest part of the temple. After breaking through, excavators found a circular chamber with a central pit opening directly above a natural underground magma reservoir. The orange light of the magma bathed the walls in a red glow, faintly illuminating inscriptions encircling the strange room. The top of the surrounding walls are studded with bright, flaming eyes.\n\nOn one edge of this pit are the desiccated remains of one of the locals, broken open upon an altar shaped like the Infernal Eye. It appears they were in fact sacrificing their own in an attempt to appease it.\n\nThe text along these walls may be critical to understanding the cultural role of this temple, and should be translated immediately."
infernals.2735.name: "Convulsing Prophecies"
infernals.2735.desc: "The final study of the scripture in the temple's innermost chamber reveals a set of prophecies relating to the return of the Infernal Eye. It speaks of the Infernal Eye growing angry at the defiance of its subjects. In response, the Eye is expected to darken the skies, erupt a specific holy mountain, cause a specific crop to wither on the vine, and more. The prophecy presents this as the end of civilization, stating that after these events, only those who submit to the Infernal Eye shall survive. \n\nOur agents among the local populace have looked for cultural connections, and found that this prophetic text is the source of many aphorisms and phrases in the planet's cultures, as well as the source text for many later stories and myths. They also believe that the mysteries practiced by their modern temples include variations on, and reactions against, this ancient prophecy. \n\nAll of these prophesied events could be re-enacted with our technology, or faked with a degree of realism they will not be able to detect. If we were to present ourselves as the Infernal Eye reincarnate, demonstrating that the original prophecy was right all along, we may be able to extract concessions and fealty from them. This would make them easier to absorb in the long term."
infernals.2735.a: "Re-enact the prophecies."
infernals.2735.a.tt: "The primitive society of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! will learn to adopt our ethics."
infernals.2735.a.fail: "Does not have the §Y$interference_not_allowed$§! policy selected."
infernals.2735.b: "Do not intervene."
infernals.2735.c: "Their history has been lost forever."
infernal_figurine: "Infernal Figurine"
infernal_figurine_desc_short: "A stout creature with a domed shell and four squat legs crouches under a stylized sculpture of fire"
infernal_figurine_desc_details: "The flame is carved from an unknown mineral that glows deep red. This artifact was excavated from the catacombs of an extinct society, and may have represented their vain hope of surviving the impending volcanic destruction of their biosphere."
