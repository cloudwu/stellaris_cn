 #Events
 situation.1005.name: "[This.GetLeviathanParadeName]"
# situation.1005.desc.small: "An overcast day greeted the middling crowd on §Y[Target.GetName]'s§! capital city today. The procession carrying our proof of the destruction of the §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! ambled past the meandering onlookers. Its progress was broadcast throughout our empire, but engagement was low as the [This.GetTrophyName] did not seem to be quite as enticing as we had hoped.\n\nAfter finishing the world tour, the [This.GetTrophyName] was placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come."
# situation.1005.desc.standard: "A bright day greeted the packed crowds on §Y[Target.GetName]§! today as the procession carrying our proof of the destruction of the §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! traveled through the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat]'s cities. The parade's progress was broadcast throughout our empire to billions of viewers. The [This.GetTrophyName] already seems to have become a staple of [Owner.Species.GetAdj] culture, inspiring artists and creators across [Owner.GetName].\n\nAfter finishing the world tour, the [This.GetTrophyName] was placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come."
# situation.1005.desc.large: "The weather on §Y[Target.GetName]§! was unnaturally great today, as it should have been, considering we ran our atmosphere control system on overdrive. Every city on the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat] reached its capacity, and there were still tourist ships orbiting the world just to be a part of this great day. The grand parade traveled through each settlement in turn, and was greeted by streets packed with [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Every city capable of requisitioning a holo-display in our empire was also overflowing with spectators for the grand hologram rebroadcasts. As the centerpiece of the parade, the [This.GetTrophyName], reached [Target.GetName]'s capital, people were already talking about making today a yearly §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! inspired holiday. The [This.GetTrophyName] was then placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come."
 situation.1005.a: "又没人来看嚷嚷着办什么庆典啊？"
 situation.1005.b: "今天是个[Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]的好日子。"
 situation.1005.c: "今天我们都是一家人。"

 situation.1045.name: "去稳定化獠牙"
# situation.1045.desc: "In preparation for the big day, we have transferred one of the §YEther Drake's Fangs§! to §Y[Target.GetName]§!. Getting them into the transport ship was a challenge, as the Ether Drake's unique biology does not seem to follow the laws of physics. The fang reacted particularly strangely to the transport ship entering the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat]'s atmosphere: it began unraveling before us, and if the transport ship hadn't responded quickly, we might have lost the coveted artifact."
 situation.1045.a: "建造一个更好的容器，把獠牙带下来。"
 situation.1045.b: "这奇怪的反应可比[Owner.GetParadeStudy]好玩多了。"
 situation.1045.b.tooltip: "取消[Owner.GetParadeStudy]以展开对反应的研究。"
 situation.1045.c: "用复制品替代獠牙。"
 situation.1045.c.tooltip: "这将会降低该机遇产出的凝聚力。"
 situation.1050.name: "监督者"
# situation.1050.desc: "The extraction of the §YShard's Eye§! was a messy process with a few false starts. Luckily, the behemoth had a lot of eyes for us to practice on. We then towed the optic to [Target.Solar_System.GetName], and something both fascinating and revolting happened: the oculus started attaching and integrating itself into the local starbase overlooking §Y[Target.GetName]§!. The cause of this is unknown, but then again, much of the Drake's physiology is beyond us.\n\nThe fusing is not complete yet, but our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] believe it has to be halted now if we wish to proceed with our previous plans."
 situation.1050.a: "让我们用裂爪龙之眼审视世界吧。"
 situation.1050.a.tooltip: "取消[Owner.GetParadeStudy]以把这只眼睛用于其他用途。"
 situation.1050.b: "快把它抠下来，最后期限要到了！"
 situation.1050.c: "小心地把它取下来，我们可不想有什么磕碰。"
 situation.1055.name: "功率骤增"
# situation.1055.desc: "The §YDreadnought's Reactor§! was a very well-behaved cargo until it arrived at §Y[Target.GetName]§!, where we placed it in a warehouse awaiting its big day. It was there the troubles began: while no one was looking, the reactor restarted itself. The warehouse was lit up from within as it spouted out huge arcs of plasma, threatening to melt down the entire building.\n\nThe quick actions of our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] were just sufficient to save it in the nick of time, with the upshot that we now have an active reactor to do with as we please."
 situation.1055.a: "把它并入[Target.GetPlanetHabitat]的电网。"
 situation.1055.b: "把它带上我们的表演。"
 situation.1055.b.tooltip: "这将会提升该机遇产出的凝聚力。"
 situation.1055.c: "寻找关闭开关"
 situation.1060.name: "再生鞭毛"
# situation.1060.desc: "Even with our xeno-contamination precautions, something went wrong. As the §YMatriarch's Flagella§! entered §Y[Target.GetName]'s§! capital, it somehow got in contact with one of the handlers, and instantly, the flagella started reacting. Pulsating ripping appendages began growing from the Trophy, first forming an indistinct churning mass of flesh. Over time it became more detailed, and to our surprise, it assumed the shape of the unfortunate handler! It seems like the regenerative powers of the Matriarch have accepted the DNA of our kind and are now in the process of generating more [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 situation.1060.a: "让围观者也一起尝尝这个！"
 situation.1060.b: "让反应自由发展吧。"
 situation.1060.c: "把鞭毛烧掉。"
 situation.1065.name: "趋之若鹜"
# situation.1065.desc: "While carrying home the §YSky Dragon's Plume§!, our transportation ship noticed that the hyperlane they traveled through had a second distortion beyond their ship. Initially disregarding this as just an anomaly, it was not apparent until the ship entered §Y[Target.Solar_System.GetName]§! that a group of pursuing entities was causing the hyperlane-dilation: a clutch of dragon whelps exited into our system in hot pursuit of our transport ship. They must have lain in hiding near the jump point and followed our exit. The dragonlings do not seem to possess the mental faculties of their progenitor and seem to be aimlessly following us or, more particularly, the plume."
 situation.1065.a: "驱逐害虫。"
 situation.1065.b: "我们得在[Target.Solar_System.GetName]为他们设立一个栖息地。"
 situation.1065.b.tooltip: "取消[Owner.GetParadeStudy]以开辟一颗小行星让幼崽居住。"
 situation.1065.c: "想象一下我们可以有一个[Owner.GetParadeStudy]直播环节！"
 situation.1065.d: "警告性开火，把它们吓跑！"
 situation.1070.name: "最致密金属"
# situation.1070.desc: "This morning, a surprise awaited us on §Y[Target.GetName]§! as the §YScavenger Bot's Compactor§! deposited the last of its creations in our storage facility. The large chunk of alloys was denser and more compact than anything we could ever hope to produce, containing enough metals in a few cubic meters to build an entire battleship. This fantastic development has our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] believing that they can get the compactor working again at §G0.001%§! efficiency, if we should wish it."
 situation.1070.a: "把它拆了用来造点东西。"
 situation.1070.b: "把它整合进[Owner.GetParadeStudy]。"
 situation.1070.c: "把压缩机丢回太空运转。"
 situation.1070.c.tooltip: "取消[Owner.GetParadeStudy]以重新激活压缩机，在[Target.GetName]的轨道上制造$d_alloys_10$矿藏。"
 situation.1075.name: "泄露囊器"
# situation.1075.desc: "The strobing lights of the §YStellar Wraith's Disperser Sack§! were distracting to look upon, so distracting that it took a while to detect that the sack the Wraith used to generate its natural shield was leaking. After quickly confirming that exposure to the chemicals inside would not cause a total ecological collapse on §Y[Target.GetName]§!, our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] focused on analyzing the effects the gas had on our atmosphere.\n\nIt seems like the emitted chemicals have fused with our mesosphere and disperse concentrated energies surprisingly well. So well that if we release the rest of the disperser's contents, there would be a noticeable increase in planetary defensiveness."
 situation.1075.a: "把里面的气体抽出来完成反应。"
 situation.1075.a.tooltip: "取消[Owner.GetParadeStudy]以将[Target.GetName]的向大气灌输$wraiths_energy_disperser$。"
 situation.1075.b: "把洞塞上。"
 situation.1075.c: "把它带上我们的表演。"
