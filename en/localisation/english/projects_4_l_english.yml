 SNEK_SCIENCE_PROJECT:0 "Use Science"
 SNEK_SCIENCE_PROJECT_DESC:1 "Science! We're using science! After a series of careful observations and productive meetings, we intend to find patterns in the ophidians' behaviors and methodically adopt plans to counter them. If we can find evidence of tool use and adaptive strategy, we may even be able to reason with them! We just need to make sure not to corrupt the data by interfering with their activities, even when they're biting colonists and siphoning power."
