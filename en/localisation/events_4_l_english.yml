 anomaly.6000.name:0 "Rogue Moon"
 # "parent planet" and "its primary", pending PARENTPLANET loc key implementation
 anomaly.6000.desc:0 "[From.GetName] does not appear to be made up of a similar material to its parent planet, indicating that is was once a rogue planetoid which has been caught in its primary's gravity well. Further study may reveal where it originally came from."
 anomaly.6001.desc:0 "[From.GetName] contains a base!"
 anomaly.6002.name:0 "Hollow Planet"
 anomaly.6002.desc:1 "After extensive study, we have concluded that [From.GetName] is an artificial construct. Their working theory is that [From.GetName] was originally a fairly normal asteroid belt which was somehow crushed together to gather the required materials and then shaped into a hollow sphere."
 anomaly.6003.desc:1 "Much to our surprise, [From.GetName] appears to have begun life as a normal planet, but it has at some point been entirely hollowed out using an unknown mining technique which has left [From.GetName] a mere empty shell."
 anomaly.6004.name:0 "Strong Magnetic Field"
 anomaly.6004.desc:0 "Initial scanning revealed little but that [From.GetName] has an unusually strong magnetic field surrounding it. This interfered with detailed scans until the [Root.GetName] moved in for a closer look. The field seems to be caused by the high density of metallic ores found the planet's crust, which will likely be a boon to local mining endeavors."
 anomaly.6005.name:0 "Abnormal Conditions"
 anomaly.6005.desc:0 "Our scans are showing that [From.GetName] is rather unusual, a closer look is required."
 anomaly.6006.name:0 "Abnormal Conditions"
 anomaly.6006.desc:0 "Our scan of [From.GetName] is complete, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has prepared a report on the unusual conditions found here."
 anomaly.6006.a:0 "Report, [Root.GetLeaderName]."
 anomaly.6007.name:0 "Mineral Rich"
 anomaly.6007.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] has an abundance of easily accessible minerals in this planet's crust, which should make mining here a lucrative business."
 anomaly.6008.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] suffers from unstable weather patterns, with violent storms frequently appearing out of nowhere to wreak havoc on the surface. Wind farms would likely be able to supply bountiful energy here."
 anomaly.6009.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] has evolved extremely hostile fauna, and the surface is rife with lethal predators waiting to ambush their next meal. Their biology offers great research opportunities."
 anomaly.6010.desc:0 "Although habitable, [From.From.GetName] has an almost non-existent magnetic field that offers little protection against cosmic radiation."
 anomaly.6011.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] has an abnormally high magnetic field, caused by rich deposits of metallic ore. This will interfere with many of our instruments and computers, but the rich mining yield should more than make up for it."
 anomaly.6012.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] has very unstable plate tectonics and is prone to massive earthquakes and volcanic activity. Deposits of valuable minerals are frequently exposed on the surface."
 anomaly.6013.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] is tidally locked around its star, meaning that one side always has daylight while the other is locked in eternal darkness. If life exists here, it is likely limited to the twilight regions where the two sides meet."
 anomaly.6014.desc:0 "It seems [From.From.GetName] was once a gas giant, but its proximity to its star has burned away the thick atmosphere. All that remains now is a super-dense and mineral rich metallic core."
 anomaly.6015.desc:0 "The orbital path [From.From.GetName] takes around its star is littered with small asteroids, meteors, and comet swarms. Large impacts on the surface occur at an alarming frequency, often leaving behind valuable mineral deposits."
 anomaly.6016.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] has an unusually large amount of natural satellites. Hundreds of small moons and moonlets orbit the planet, many possessing valuable mineral deposits."
 anomaly.6017.desc:0 "It appears that [From.From.GetName] been formed mostly out of carbon, and contains little oxygen. Not only is it rich in minerals, but volcanic eruptions frequently bring diamonds from the interior to the surface."
 anomaly.6018.desc:0 "Spectacular electrical storms wrack [From.From.GetName]'s atmosphere on a semi-regular basis. While it will likely not be much fun for the inhabitants, there are ample research opportunities here."
 anomaly.6019.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] has an unusually low density, and therefore much lower gravity than most planets of comparable size."
 anomaly.6020.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] is unusually dense, and so has uncomfortably high gravity. However, the amount of heavy metals present should greatly aid Physics research."
 anomaly.6021.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] has either been artificially created or was somehow hollowed out. How or why we do not know, but investigating it promises to be fascinating."
 anomaly.6022.desc:0 "The cornucopia of easily accessible minerals in [From.From.GetName]'s crust provides a truly staggering opportunity for mining."
 anomaly.6023.desc:0 "It is unknown if [From.From.GetName] was simply formed this way, or if some unknown race once stripped it of resources. However, we do know that there are very few minerals to be found here."
 anomaly.6024.desc:0 "The lifeforms of [From.From.GetName] are built on a massive scale and can be incredibly dangerous even without meaning any harm. The less said about the gargantuan predators of this world the better, but they do represent a treasure trove of research data if any scientists are brave enough to try."
 anomaly.6025.desc:0 "Perhaps [From.From.GetName] once had a moon which was destroyed in some calamity, or perhaps its orbital debris never fully coalesced in the first place. Whatever the cause, this planet is surrounded by a belt of small asteroids."
 anomaly.6026.desc:0 "The scenery of [From.From.GetName] is simply beautiful, anyone living on this planet will be constantly finding new wonders to behold."
 anomaly.6027.desc:0 "Something in the air of [From.From.GetName] seems to put people in the mood to... reproduce. Needless to say, this rather made the ground-based part of the survey somewhat awkward."
 anomaly.6028.desc:0 "The air of [From.From.GetName] contains a natural hallucinogen. While this will keep people happy, and indeed it seems to aid the visualization of some of the more esoteric Physics problems, it will also distract people from other work."
 anomaly.6029.desc:0 "Life thrives on [From.From.GetName], the fauna is plentiful and the flora grows rapidly."
 anomaly.6030.desc:0 "Life struggles to survive on [From.From.GetName], and while some clings to a tenacious existence it is anemic and sickly."
 anomaly.6031.desc:0 "Some long-ago calamity rendered [From.From.GetName] rather heavily irradiated. With the passage of time it has become marginally habitable again, but so far little can grow here."
 anomaly.6660.desc.start:1 "As our Science Ship scans the surface of [From.GetName] it becomes quite clear that we have found something out of the ordinary."

 colony_mod.1.desc:0 "While it's obvious that some past calamity released a vast amount of radiation on [Root.GetName], it's not obvious what caused it. This mystery is now bothering more and more of the colonists who have made [Root.GetName] their home. After all, if we don't know how this happened, what is to say it could not happen again?"
 colony_mod.1.a:0 "Let's get to the bottom of this!"
 colony_mod.2.name:0 "Titanic Life"
 colony_mod.2.desc:0 "The native life of [Root.GetName] is built on an epic scale, far larger than anyone previously thought was possible for biological life. The question now of the minds of our researchers is "What is their secret, and can we benefit from it?" Proposals to study the native life in greater detail are flooding in."

 colony_mod.17.name:1 "Magnetic Disruption"
 colony_mod.17.desc:1 "The Strong Magnetic Field around [Root.GetName] has always caused some problems with electronic instruments on the surface, but recently the effect on our computers has been especially notable.
