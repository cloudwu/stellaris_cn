 crisis.252.desc:0 "In the recent fleet engagement against the Prethoryn in the [battle_system.GetName] system, our forces managed to capture some sort of egg that was being transported by one of their Queens. The egg hatched shortly afterwards, and a §HBrood-Queen§! emerged.\n\nThrough the use of neural transmitters, our scientists have managed to pacify the creature. It will now obey our commands as if they had been issued by the Prethoryn hive mind itself. We could potentially use this Queen to grow a small Prethoryn brood of our own."

 crisis.1250.desc:0 "When the swirling energies left behind after the destruction of the last dimensional portal finally dissipated, our forces found a weakened extradimensional drifting nearby. The creature was captured and interrogated.\n\nIt is apparently one of their "§HWarlocks§!" - a powerful extradimensional even by their standards, responsible for maintaining the portal's link between our reality and theirs. If we can study or even channel its psionic power, we should be able to greatly improve our sublight speeds and jump drive range."

 site_command_center:0 "Asteroid Blast Door"
 site_command_center_intro:0 "A collision with a smaller asteroid has revealed a small blast door or airlock extending slightly from the surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. It appears to be thousands of years old, and had previously been concealed by rocks and dust.\n\nFor unknown reasons, scans cannot penetrate the asteroid's interior and the blast door is impervious to conventional cutting tools. To learn what is behind this door, a team would likely have to dig their way towards the center of the asteroid from another direction."
 ancrel.6005.name:0 "Drilling a Hole"
 ancrel.6005.desc:0 "A very large structure of some kind occupies most of the interior of asteroid [From.Planet.GetName]. The blast door which once served as this structure's only entrance still can't be opened, but a passage has been dug from the other side of the asteroid.\n\nDrills have so far been unable to penetrate the thick outer walls of the structure, but this method still seems to afford the best chance of gaining access. Despite their age, the blast doors have proven nearly invulnerable."
 ancrel.6010.name:0 "Entrance"
 ancrel.6010.desc:0 "A hole has finally been drilled through the outer walls of structure inside [From.Planet.GetName]. The interior is a vast command center or bunker of some sort, littered with the decayed remains of thousands of dead aliens.\n\nSifting through all this to gain a clearer picture of what exactly was going on inside this asteroid will take considerable time."
 ancrel.6015.name:0 "Command Center"
 ancrel.6015.desc:0 "This asteroid once served as the hidden capital of a relatively large interstellar empire that dominated this section of the galaxy several thousand years ago. From this fortified command center, the ruling elite along with thousands of military and civilian officials administered the empire while safe from the violent reprisals their harsh policies often inspired.\n\nContact with the rest of their empire seems to have been handled exclusively through encrypted subspace transmissions and a single freighter which made periodic visits to resupply the base and transfer personnel."
 ancrel.6020.name:0 "The Final Days"
 ancrel.6020.desc:0 "From what can be pieced together, it appears that the resupply freighter collided with the asteroid due to a thruster malfunction. The resulting explosion damaged the blast doors and destroyed the asteroid's subspace transmitter, permanently severing all contact with the outside world.\n\nTrapped and with no hope of rescue, the asteroid's inhabitants slowly succumbed to starvation or suicide. The last logs of their single surviving subspace receiver confirm that their empire, suddenly bereft of its capital, descended into civil war and anarchy."
 
 site_hunting_ground:0 "Fossilized Remains"
 site_hunting_ground_intro:0 "Fossilized remains from several different species that do not appear to have been indigenous to [From.Planet.GetName] have been found in a large and secluded valley on the planet. They all date from roughly the same time period, within the span of a few centuries some 3.6 million years ago.\n\nEach of these species seems to have evolved in its own unique biosphere, and all appear to have been sapient. Strangely, every fossilized individual found so far shows signs of having met a violent end."
 ancrel.6050.name:0 "More Remains"
 ancrel.6050.desc:0 "Archaeologists have unearthed more and more fossilized remains in the valley, and the count is now up to 26 distinct sapient species, none of them native to [From.Planet.GetName]. Those fossils that have been sufficiently preserved to determine a cause of death all point towards physical trauma inflicted by blades, spears, or arrows. Not a single specimen appears to have been felled by the equivalent of modern projectile or energy weapons.\n\nThe ruins of a small structure of some sort have been found near the entrance of the valley. It appears to originate from the same time period as the fossils. Perhaps it will shed some light on things."
 ancrel.6055.name:0 "The Lodge"
 ancrel.6055.desc:0 "The excavation of the ancient structure found near the valley's entrance is proceeding according to plan. Many artifacts have been discovered, most of which seem to be variations of hunting weapons and trophies. A partially translated sign, which appears to denote the name of the structure, reads:\n\n§H"VALLEY OF MAK'VAEHL - HUNTING LODGE PRIMUS"§!"
 ancrel.6060.name:0 "The Retarax Domain"
 ancrel.6060.desc:0 "Continued excavations near the hunting lodge have provided more details. [From.Planet.GetName] - and the Valley of Mak'vaehl, specifically - served as a hunting reserve for the ruling warrior class of an interstellar polity known as the §HRetarax Domain§!.\n\nThe Retarax, a predatory avian species, periodically collected random individuals from the many subjugated alien civilizations under their rule. These aliens were then hunted down and killed in the wilderness of Mak'vaehl, according to the rituals that governed Retarax society. This tradition lasted several centuries, until the Domain eventually succumbed to an undefined outside threat."
 ancrel.6065.name:0 "The Huntress"
 ancrel.6065.desc:0 "Archaeologists excavating the hunting lodge have stumbled upon several references to a legendary Retarax warrior known only as §H"The Huntress."§! She was apparently their most efficient killer, renowned throughout the Domain for having personally butchered thousands of aliens at Mak'vaehl.\n\nIt is unclear whether this is based on fact or fiction, but according to Retarax legend the Huntress was killed somewhere inside the valley when she was outwitted by the alien prey she was pursuing. She was supposedly wielding the fabled §H"Blade of the Huntress"§! at the time."
 ancrel.6070.name:0 "The Blade of the Huntress"
 ancrel.6070.desc:0 "After painstakingly combing through the Valley of Mak'vaehl for any trace of the legendary Huntress, archaeologists were finally able to pinpoint her last resting place. Her fossilized skeleton was found locked in battle with the remains of a large horned arthropoid, with her claws still clasping the hilt of a perfectly preserved sword.\n\nThis must be the §HBlade of the Huntress§!. The weapon is composed of an unknown material and is sharp enough to cut straight through our strongest armor."
 
 ancrel.6099.name:0 "Chameleon Field Exposed"
 ancrel.6099.desc:0 "A chameleon energy field of some sort concealing an ancient structure was recently exposed on the surface of §H[tomb_planet.GetName]§!, a lifeless [tomb_planet.GetPlanetMoon] inside our space. Only a chance asteroid impact which was deflected off the field while the [tomb_planet.GetPlanetMoon] was being monitored by a passing freighter revealed its existence."
 ancrel.6099.a:0 "This should be investigated."
 site_zarqlan:0 "Ancient Tomb"
 site_zarqlan_intro:0 "A chameleon energy field of some sort concealed an ancient structure on the surface of this planet. Only a chance asteroid impact which was deflected off the field while it was being monitored revealed its existence.\n\nWith the field deactivated, archaeologists will now have access to the large and forbidding building complex that was hidden beneath it."
 ancrel.6100.name:0 "The Mausoleum"
 ancrel.6100.desc:0 "The structure appears to be a gigantic mausoleum or necropolis, dating back several million years. There are no obvious signs of previous looters, so the structure may have been left untouched since the chameleon field was erected.\n\nThe structure's First Chamber is accessible, but an impenetrable door blocks any further progress. Large alien glyphs, as yet untranslated, have been carved into the wall above the door."
 ancrel.6105.name:0 "The First Chamber"
 ancrel.6105.desc:0 "The alien glyphs above the door have been translated as follows:\n\n§H"I am ZARQLAN, the Guardian of MOZ-TARB, the Prophet of ZVA. In a galaxy awash with spite and hatred, I have chosen to seclude myself here. Proceed, if ye be worthy."§!\n\nAfter combing through the First Chamber for anything of interest, archaeologists discovered a tiny concealed wall panel. When pressed, the ancient door rumbled open. The Second Chamber can now be accessed."
 ancrel.6110.name:0 "The Second Chamber"
 ancrel.6110.desc:0 "The Second Chamber is unremarkable, aside from another set of alien glyphs above a closed door. They read:\n\n§H"Petty kings issued edicts in my name. Empires waged war in my honor. Fools sang my praises. I would have none of it."§!\n\nNo secret wall panel has yet been found that would provide access to the Third Chamber."
 ancrel.6115.name:0 "The Third Chamber"
 ancrel.6115.desc:0 "After a long and tiring search, a secret lever hidden under the floor was found which provided access to the Fourth Chamber. As before, alien glyphs adorned the wall above yet another door:\n\n§H"Those who wish to parlay with ZARQLAN must first find their way. There is, in each chamber, a hidden key that must be turned to proceed. The purpose of these challenges will soon be revealed."§!"
 ancrel.6120.name:0 "The Fourth Chamber"
 ancrel.6120.desc:0 "This time the lever was concealed in the roof. The Fifth Chamber has more alien writing:\n\n§H"There is none. The challenges are as meaningless as these words. That is my lesson. I am ZARQLAN, the pawn. Swept along by the currents of history against my will. Proceed and an audience shall be yours, should one still be of interest."§!\n\nThe next chamber is likely to be the last."
 ancrel.6125.name:0 "The Final Chamber"
 ancrel.6125.desc:0 "After a grueling search, the last "key" was discovered in the form of a minuscule button hidden in one of the carved alien glyphs. In the last chamber, a gigantic throne holds the slumped and motionless form of a large humanoid figure. A horrible smell hints at the decayed state of the being's body. Some glyphs at the bottom of the throne read simply: §H"ZARQLAN, AT YOUR SERVICE"§!\n\nThe body is too far gone to be moved, but the head is surprisingly well-preserved given its age. Not wanting to leave empty handed, some archaeologists use a laser cutter to remove the head."
 ancrel.6130.desc:0 "It... it is true then. You have found the legendary tomb of Zarqlan. When the Augurs told me, I did not believe them, but the evidence is irrefutable. I understand that you have the Prophet's head in your possession?\n\nThen as was foretold, the chosen of the great Zarqlan have at last been revealed. As would have been Zarqlan's wish, any unsettled holy worlds near our space are yours to do with as you wish.

 ancrel.6150.desc:0 "As confirmed by its recent survey, §H[From.GetName]§! is surrounded by an incredibly strong energy field that deflects all attempts to scan it. The field appears to be generated from the planet's nearby moon."
 ancrel.6151.desc:0 "§H[From.GetName]§! is emitting an impenetrable energy barrier that surrounds the planet it orbits. The exact source of the barrier is difficult to pinpoint, but it appears to be coming from somewhere deep beneath the moon's barren surface.\n\nAncient ruins of what must have been a large base of some sort, possibly of a military nature, can be found inside one of the moon's largest craters. It may hold some answers."

 site_minigalaxy_1:0 "Moon Base"
 site_minigalaxy_1_intro:0 "Ruins of a large base complex of some kind can be found inside a large crater on this moon. It must have been abandoned thousands of years ago. The energy barrier that encompasses the nearby planet appears to originate from a source directly beneath this ancient base."
 ancrel.6155.name:0 "The Armistice Initiative"
 ancrel.6155.desc:0 "Continued excavations of the ruins on §H[From.Planet.GetName]§! have revealed that the abandoned base was once a massive military installation built by the "§HArmistice Initiative§!." They were a semi-permanent alliance of at least five large and very advanced interstellar powers active in this galactic region some 75,000 years ago.\n\nThe exact nature of this alliance is unknown, but it appears to have been committed to bringing an immediate end to several long-running galactic wars. Large military contingents from each Initiative member were stationed at the base on this moon."
 ancrel.6160.name:0 "Belligerent Party C"
 ancrel.6160.desc:0 "The shielded planet in this system was the capital of one of the warring empires the Armistice Initiative was formed to stop. This empire's name is still unknown - they are referred to simply as "§HBelligerent Party C§!" in all Initiative records recovered so far.\n\nApparently, the Armistice Initiative sought to make an example of Belligerent Party C. After invading their space and winning several hard-fought battles, the Initiative permanently imprisoned the homeworld of Party C behind an energy shield. A military base was established on the nearby moon to maintain the shield and act as a response force in the unlikely event of containment failure."
 ancrel.6165.name:0 "The Shield Generator"
 ancrel.6165.desc:0 "The Initiative moon base was kept operational for several centuries, but with no signs of containment failure the forces were gradually scaled back. Shifting alliances and infighting between the various Initiative members eventually left the base completely deserted.\n\nAutomated systems were left in place to maintain the shield surrounding Party C's homeworld, and they have, incredibly, remained functional up until now. Alas, a critical power cable was severed when our archaeologists dug their way into the subterranean generator chamber. After 75,000 years of continuous operation, the shield is no more."

 site_minigalaxy_2:0 "Abandoned Ecumenopolis"
 site_minigalaxy_2_intro:0 "This ancient Relic World was imprisoned behind an impenetrable energy barrier for roughly 75,000 years.

 ancrel.6170.name:0 "Disappearance"
 ancrel.6170.desc:0 "The disappearance of this planet's original population remains a mystery. Once the shield went up and they were isolated from the rest of their interstellar empire, they likely faced mass famine and civil unrest as they struggled to support their capital's massive population with what limited resources they had.\n\nYet there are no signs that they demolished parts of their city planet to cultivate the land. Nothing suggests that any significant fighting took place after the shield went up, and there are no remains, fossilized or otherwise, of the inhabitants. It's like they simply vanished into thin air."
 ancrel.6175.name:0 "Evacuation Day"

 ancrel.6180.desc:0 "The planet was clearly abandoned after this "Evacuation Day" concluded, but how? There is no evidence that the planet's energy barrier ever went down.\n\nClues have been discovered that indicate the pursuit of some sort of massive research project that predates the shield. Resources and science staff were diverted to this project in increasing numbers, and efforts appear to have greatly intensified after the shield went up."
 ancrel.6185.name:0 "Miniaturized Galaxy"
 ancrel.6185.desc:0 "After intense search efforts, we have discovered where the inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName] went. Deep inside a tall fortified structure near the planet's northern pole, we found a relic that our archaeologists are convinced holds an actual miniaturized galaxy.\n\nSomehow, after creating this galaxy, the inhabitants of the Relic World all relocated there and then sealed it in this container with some kind of impervious subspace field. While we can't interfere with the galaxy itself, our scientists assure us that we can study it."

 ancrel.6200.name:0 "Pleasure Palace"
 ancrel.6200.desc:0 "The present dark and lifeless interior of the space station almost succeeds in hiding the fact that it must have been designed as some kind of luxurious pleasure palace. There are seemingly endless rows of rusty slot machines, hundreds of decrepit bars and restaurants, and amidst it all, thousands of bodies.\n\nDead, partially mummified aliens of at least a dozen different species can be found everywhere, but most of the bodies are clustered around the empty escape pod bays."
 ancrel.6205.name:0 "The Star Petal"
 ancrel.6205.desc:0 "This derelict station was once known as the "§HStar Petal§!" and it was apparently a celebrated luxury resort in this corner of the galaxy nearly a thousand years ago. A small fleet of tugs would drag the station to a new exotic location each year, but [From.Planet.GetName] appears to have been its last.\n\nFor unclear reasons, the station was pulled into the gas giant's atmosphere where it suffered critical damage."
 ancrel.6210.name:0 "The Final Days"
 ancrel.6210.desc:0 "The archaeologists working on the Star Petal have gathered sufficient clues and evidence to paint a reasonably clear picture of the station's final days. A stray asteroid impacted the station, knocking it into an orbit that would soon plunge it into [From.Planet.GetName]'s atmosphere.\n\nStation-keeping thrusters could not compensate, and the command staff soon issued an evacuation order. Unfortunately, the station only had enough escape pods to evacuate a fraction of its passengers and mass panic soon erupted. Those who were not trampled to death perished when the station's environmental systems failed as it drifted deeper into the gas giant."

 ancrel.3.desc:0 "A large crystal has been found inside what we now know to have been the colony's central administrative center. In some way, the crystal wanted to be found and seems to be trying to communicate with us. Perhaps with further study communication will be possible?"
 ancrel.3.a:0 "Probe the Crystal"
 ancrel.4.desc:0 "After a great deal of trial and error, a breakthrough has been made. The crystal is some kind of Psionic Archive, but its records are fragmented. What we know is that this was a colony of The Zroni, a psionically gifted race who discovered a dimension which came to be known as "The Shroud". Once the Zroni population reached a certain critical mass it seems that their collective unconscious minds began to make contact with the proto-shroud in dreams, leading to mass lucid dreaming. Soon the phenomenon was studied and the Zroni discovered how to psionically project themselves into the Shroud, where they found that they could manipulate the very fabric of reality with their psionic powers. It wasn't long before the Zroni discovered they could physically enter the Shroud and live like Gods, transforming the dimension to suit their whims...\n\nThe Archive's records end there, with no information on what happened to the inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName]. But while there are no answers here, we have learned of another Zroni colony which may contain a more complete Archive."
 ancrel.5.desc:0 "[From.Planet.GetName] contains the ruins of another abandoned Zroni colony. The first step to solving this mystery is to find and make contact with this world's Psionic Archive."
 ancrel.6.desc:0 "Using protocols established with the previous crystal it was much easier to establish contact with this one. Again its records are fragmented, but we have learned that another advantage of being able to enter the Shroud was that the Shroud touches all parts of the physical galaxy (perhaps all parts of the universe) simultaneously. If one can enter the Shroud, it is possible to exit it at any known location. This ability to "Psionically jump" between physical locations allowed the Zroni to spread to all corners of the galaxy, although because they spent most of their time within the Shroud they made few permanent colonies which were mostly located near to their homeworld.\n\n The crystal also gave us the location of another colony."
 ancrel.7.desc:0 "Finding and communicating with the crystal archives has become much easier now. Contact can be made as soon as our expedition lands, and more detailed records and concepts can be accessed. From what we have learned here, some things are too good to be true, and so it was with the Shroud-granted Godhood of the Zroni. The energy needed to power the vast changes in the Shroud's composition had to come from somewhere, and it was finally found to originate from the massive black hole at the center of the galaxy. As the Zroni made their changes within the Shroud, so the singularity expanded, consuming the mass of the galactic center and converting it into energy which was siphoned into the Shroud. This discovery shook the Zroni, debate turn to argument, turned to division, turned to civil war between two main factions."
 ancrel.8.desc:0 "Further details of the Zroni civil war factions have been extracted from the crystal: One faction, which came to be known as "The Divine", felt that the fate of the physical galaxy was of no concern to the Zroni, who could continue their omnipotent existence in the Shroud until the entire galaxy was consumed in some unimaginably far off future- and even then, there are other galaxies, perhaps even other universes which could possibly be consumed. The other faction, "The Saviors", were aghast at this- the Zroni could not destroy the galaxy to live as parasitic gods! Even outside of the Shroud, their Psionic abilities guaranteed them a utopian existence.\n\n The location of another Zroni colony was also discovered."
 ancrel.9.desc:0 "It was strangely difficult to locate the Archive on [From.Planet.GetName], but once found it was easy to see why: It has been shattered and contains no records that we can access. However, a faint signal suggests that there may be something else to find here."
 ancrel.9.a:0 "Continue Searching"
 ancrel.10.desc:0 "A much smaller psionic crystal has been located in some kind of laboratory. The Zroni who recorded their findings within were extremely frustrated that their research was ridiculed by their peers and largely discredited. They believed that the Zroni were no longer the only entities in the Shroud, and that the collective fears and desires of their entire race were coalescing into distinct, sapient entities. Desiring to grow stronger, these entities had begun to subtly influence the emotions and thoughts of suitable Zroni, slowly causing their behaviors to become more extreme which may have caused the Zroni civil war.\n\nWe also discovered a reference to the location of one of the Zroni's major colonies."
 ancrel.11.desc:0 "Unlike the previous Zroni worlds, [From.Planet.GetName] was clearly a major colony with several huge cities and numerous smaller ones covering the surface. But like the others it is empty and shows no signs of disaster or death, leaving the fate of the population unknown. Several Archive crystals have been detected and will need to be investigated."
 ancrel.12.desc:0 "Most of the accessible records focus on the course of the war. Our working theory is that the thoughts of the population influences the "strength" of the record about a subject, causing the most thought about issues to be the most strongly recorded. Unsurprisingly, the course of the war was on everyone's mind: The majority of the Zroni sided with the Saviors, but while the Saviors had the numbers they were at a major disadvantage. Careless of the effects on the galaxy, the Divine were free to use their full Psionic might while the Saviors were limited by what power could be drawn from their own bodies. At first the war seemed hopeless, but eventually a hero among the Saviors made a terrible yet vital discovery."
 ancrel.12.a:0 "Investigate the Discovery"
 ancrel.13.desc:0 "The crystal tells us how a rogue Zroni researcher, working on a theory which his peers refused to believe, turned his power inwards, consuming his own body in a contained Psionic chain-reaction. Following his last instructions, the dusty residue of his supreme sacrifice was tested and confirmed to be an incredibly potent source of Psionic energy. It was essentially the total Psionic potential of his life, but able to be used instantly by another Psion.\n\nThe crystal also contains the location of the Zroni homeworld."
 ancrel.13.a:0 "The dust... is the Zroni!"
 ancrel.15.desc:0 "Zron is wracked by storms of psionic energy, and appears to only be partially in phase with the rest of the universe at times. Whatever calamity befell the Zroni seems to have originated here.\n\nLike all the previous colonies, it is devoid of any Zroni, but it is teeming with crystal signals. With so many of them and the strange conditions, it may take some time for us to locate any useful information."
 ancrel.16.desc:0 "We have found and communicated with several crystals, including one from the outcast Shroud-entity researchers, to learn more about the Zroni's war: Using the Zro dust required great sacrifice from the Saviors but with it they were able to turn the tide against the Divine. However, as defeat loomed the ever-increasing rage and fear of the Divine spawned new and terrible entities within the Shroud. The feedback loop grew, pushing the Divine into the depths of madness and produced ever-worsening atrocities while the Saviors became more and more driven to end the war at any cost."
 ancrel.16.a:0 "Continue"
 ancrel.17.desc:0 "As we communicate with more crystals, more details emerge: The Divine, on the brink of defeat, decided upon their ultimate plan: The end of the cycle. The core black hole's growth would be accelerated to consume the galaxy as soon as possible. At worst, the Saviors (and every other species) would be destroyed, leaving the Divine to rule the shroud for a vast but finite time, but it was possible that the expansion would become self-sustaining, consuming not just the galaxy but the universe itself, providing if not infinite energy then a close enough amount to make no practical difference."
 ancrel.18.desc:0 "We have learned the fate of the Zroni: When the Saviors learned of the Divine's plan, they knew there was only one possible counter as the Divine's defenses in the Shroud were almost impenetrable. Faced with annihilation, they choose to sacrifice their entire population, besides one Zroni. This last remaining Savior used the psionic residue of an entire species to destroy every Zroni, and thus every Divine, in existence, ending the threat for all time. Beyond a small amount of unconsumed dust, the Zroni were wiped out almost without a trace."
 ancrel.18.a:0 "Inconceivable"
 ancrel.19.desc:0 "As our expedition made ready to leave, one of the psionic crystals suddenly made contact again and indicated it could prove useful and should be taken with us. Even if it's claim isn't true, none of the other crystals seemed sapient, so this warrants further investigation."

 ancrel.23.desc:0 "Once an entrance to the data center had been found and passage forced through the wreckage it was surprisingly easy to reactivate and interface with the computer systems. Self-repairing circuits and learning algorithms quickly came online to restore limited functionality and communicate with our own computers. The reason for this quickly became clear, [From.Planet.GetName] was once the capital of a Machine Empire known as "The Omnicodex". Named after their driving purpose, the Omni were a hybrid of robots and cyborgs, who had attempted to assimilate a sample of all biological life in the galaxy in order to prevent their extinction in an unknown galactic calamity. From the surviving records, we gather that this was not popular with the other galactic powers of their era, and they were eventually defeated and destroyed by a combined attack by several of them. However, before their downfall the Omni sampled many races and much work was put into devolving a device which could re-create them if the need ever arose. This device, The Omnicodex itself, is stored somewhere nearby."
 ancrel.24.desc:0 "The Omnicodex has been unearthed. This unique device contains the genetic sequence of every race that the Omni were able to sample, and is able to re-create them using only basic elements as raw materials. Unfortunately, it seems the Omni did not have time to perfect it before being annihilated so there is no way to select which of the many sampled races are created in any given activation of the device."

The ship was found with the prow pointing downward, which leads to the assumption that it went straight into the planet at extremely high velocity. We will probably never know why.\n\nHow the ship managed to retain structural integrity despite all this is up for debate, but the strongest theory is that it was encased in some form of advanced energy field far beyond our own most cutting edge technologies.

As astonishing as it sounds, it now seems clear that the shards are the remnants of some enormous hatched egg. Based on the size and number of shell fragments, the egg must have been hundreds of meters across. Deep in the bedrock of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName] some tremendous creature hatched, and then proceeded to dig its way up to the surface, trailing deadly radiation in its wake.

It roamed with impunity, scouring the surface clean of all organic matter it touched. The trenches were dug out by the indigenous population of diminutive mustelid-like humanoids, in order to either escape the snail's onslaught, or to try to attack its vulnerable underbelly. By the extent of the excavation, this trench war must have gone on for generations, perhaps centuries.\n\nThere are no indications the local population survived the crisis, nor are there any remains of the behemoth that devoured them.

A teeming mass of beings, seeming the bulk of the inhabitants, is crowding a public square. They are chanting, the collective voices rising in crescendo like the sound of a melodic, rolling thunderstorm.\n\nThe mass chant was translated as: "The ascension is nigh. Carry us, O Grand Herald, into a new beginning. Lead us from a land of tears and dust, and grant us a new home amongst the stars. We follow thee as one. We follow thee"."

 ancrel.9290.desc:1 "§HThe Hymn of Following§! was not an isolated event - it was global, every single inhabitant chanting in unison. Such an unusual event warranted further research, and that's when a new insight was gained. A document called §HThe Pilgrimage of Last Days§! was uncovered, and it seems to be one of the last links in this mysterious chain of events.\n\nThe document refers to a specific location on the planet, where some final reckoning or ritual will occur; a swathe of unremarkable desert location neglected in earlier surveys. The document also speaks of something called §HThe Rite of Lifted Veil§!, which is now being interpreted."
 ancrel.9295.name:0 "The Ark of Legacy"
 ancrel.9295.desc:2 "Hidden from orbital scanning by sophisticated optical camouflage, §HThe Grand Herald§! was finally uncovered. It's not a prophet or religious figure; it is a gigantic Titan Class spaceship! Their world torn and dying due to wars carried out in the name of religion, the Titan was going to serve as an ark ship for a fraction of the population, transporting them off the doomed planet and towards an unspecified promised land offworld. The ship is fully assembled and workable condition, so why it never took flight is puzzling.\n\nIt appears as if some final battle must have been fought just prior to takeoff. A struggle so fierce that neither side survived in the long run."
 ancrel.9300.name:0 "The Guardian of Entirety"
 ancrel.9300.desc:1 "It was never a religious archetype! After having deactivated an optical camouflage field, the expedition saw the true shape of §HThe Grand Herald§!; an immense Titan Class spaceship half-buried in the sand, built to fight some kind of approaching threat in space. As it turns out, the poetic, metaphorical nature of the native language - interpreted as being of religious expression - was in fact just the normal way this species communicated.\n\nThe nature of the oncoming menace is still a mystery, but from the looks of it, whatever it was seems to have arrived before the Titan was fully operational. Scattered around the ship are thousands of desiccated remains of the extinct species of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName]. They did not have time to activate their Titan, and they never will."

Where spiritual metaphor and archaeological fact intersect is still not entirely clear, but we know this: whatever threat §HThe Testament of Omen§! spoke of must have indeed come to pass, as the entire population died mysteriously prior to The Grand Herald project being concluded.\n\nBut the automated construction yard kept working, finalizing a ship without passengers. The mostly intact, empty ship has been slumbering here for eons without someone to pilot it. Shall we take it out for a spin?"

The spikes are porous, covered with perforations ranging in size up to that of a strike craft. Perhaps they are related to how these bio-structures propagate themselves?"

The living network "breathes", and its exhalations cycle the current of the seas.\n\nThe size of these formations, as well as the sheer number of them across the ocean floor, hints that they are responsible for the unexplained underwater currents of [From.Planet.GetName]."

 ancrel.9320.desc:1 "Another deep sea expedition has returned, and revealed the truth of the churning seas of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName]. All the strange organic formations on the planet are actually connected in a single, vast coral reef. This coral, as it turned out, is partly aware, although with an utterly alien mindset compared to our conception of sentient life. Through pheromones excreted in the water, it has more or less enslaved the rest of all the organisms in the sea, controlling their behavior and reproduction cycles to fit its own needs.\n\nIt seems to be completely benign, but it is a puppet master nonetheless. Is it simply the apex life form on this world? An intrusive alien parasite? Communicating with it seems impossible, so we may never know."
 ancrel.9325.name:0 "Bio-Savior"
 ancrel.9325.desc:1 "After sequencing the alien DNA, a startling revelation was made: the global sea coral network is not only not native to this world, but it is in fact a bio-engineered construct rather than a natural formation. Beneath the thick carpet of alien coral is a fossilized extinction layer of the entire previous ecosystem of this world. It seems the coral, once introduced, gradually choked out all the native life and replaced it with an ecosystem tailored specifically for itself.\n\nThere are two main theories as to why this might have been done: either the artificial coral was introduced for benign reasons, and then it massively out-competed the local wildlife in an unexpected way, or it was deliberately constructed to be some sort of terrifying biological weapon to cleanse ocean worlds of native life."

This bio-engineered machine was introduced to the planet with the purpose of artificially jump starting the basic prerequisites of organic existence.\n\nApparently it worked, as underwater flora and fauna now thrives on the world. No trace was found of why such a colossal undertaking was carried out, nor by whom - was it perhaps some terraforming project by an unknown aquatic species with advanced biotechnology, seeking to create for themselves a new home?"

 ancrel.9340.name:0 "Otherworldly Waters"
 ancrel.9340.desc:1 "The answer to the mysterious craters in the ocean floor was finally found in an analysis of the water itself. Traces of certain minerals and chemical compositions proved that the water did in fact not belong to the same planet. It was transported here in the form of gargantuan blocks of ice that were hurled down on the planet. The ice blocks crashed, cracked into splinters and melted, eventually covering almost the entire surface with water.\n\nIt was an absolutely monumental undertaking, but there is nothing that hints to why it was carried out."

 ancrel.9360.desc:1 "The surface expedition sent down to [From.Planet.GetName] started to investigate one of the round islands, and soon made a remarkable discovery. The island had a complex tunnel network running beneath it, winding through the strange, oily rock. These tunnels were remarkably even and round, and laced the entire island. They seem to be natural formations, not intentionally excavated, but they have certainly not been shaped in a conventional, geological manner."
 ancrel.9365.name:0 "Tunnels Everywhere"
 ancrel.9365.desc:1 "As the surface expedition delved deeper into the round islands, two more discoveries were made: First, that every island seem to have a duplicate internal layout of tunnels beneath them. They vary slightly in size, but not in how they are laid out. The second discovery was even more astonishing: the islands aren't parts of the planet crust - they actually float! Their lower levels are filled with pockets of gas, which combined with the fairly brittle and porous island rock makes then buoyant."
 ancrel.9370.name:0 "Frozen Jelly"
 ancrel.9370.desc:1 "The answer to the mystery of the floating islands was not found in the field of geology, but in biology. The islands are in fact enormous fossilized jellyfish creatures. Millions of years ago an ice age froze them all to death, after which their carcasses were fossilized into the islands seen bobbing around in the water today. Ages of debris accretion gave their exposed surface the look of natural islands, but beneath that they are entirely organic."
 ancrel.9375.name:1 "Natural Slumber"
 ancrel.9375.desc:1 "They are not islands at all, but jellyfish! Each of these floating circles is in fact a giant invertebrate organism. And they aren't dead, either: the seemingly fossilized state is just a natural part of their life cycle. Over the course of thousands of years, these stony islands release sediment until they finally dissolve completely. The sediment contains microscopic polyps that eventually germinate in the water until they enter the next stage of their life cycle."
 ancrel.9380.name:0 "Big Ones Couldn't Cope"

It seems their introduction did not go exactly as planned, however. Most of the big ones died and fossilized - becoming the floating island archipelago - but the smaller jellyfish creatures assimilated and are now thriving in the oceans across the planet. Whether they will eventually share the fate of their bigger ancestors remains to be seen."

 ### Church of the Endless Expanse
 # Archaeological Site 1

 endless_expanse_digsite_desc:0 "At first sight there is only snow and ice on [From.Planet.GetName]. Vast expanses of impenetrable white, glass lakes and jagged turquoise glaciers against fiery orange skies torn open like a wound, pouring red into the seas as [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName]'s stars set. If the world had an end this would be it. Here the seas lie still and the snow untouched. The only sounds are the thunder of the ice calving and the wind howling across the plains.\n\nYet, [From.Planet.GetName] was once someone's home. In the midst of a wide barren field the black metal framework of a steeple protrudes from the white masses. What forgotten secrets could be buried beneath the snow?"
 ancrel.4040.name:0 "Church of the Endless Expanse"
 ancrel.4040.desc:0 "The archaeological team has laid bare the remains of a modest temple. Delicately carved from an organic alien material the exterior was once brightly colored but has faded to a dull gray. A fully operational holographic priest still presides over the church. While the temple was in use she took confessions from wayfaring penitents offering healing, reconciliation and sanctuary to this otherwise inhospitable nook of the universe.\n\nUnusual mechanical confessional chairs akin to torture devices have led the archaeologists to believe there may be more to the temple than meets the eye."
 ancrel.4041.name:0 "Oblivion"
 ancrel.4041.desc:0 "Hidden under the floor tiles in the sacristy, the archaeologists have discovered a secret crypt where the walls are lined with rows upon rows of tiny blue digital orbs, their circuitry glittering in the dark. Each orb contains the memory of a single confession and can be plugged into a cryptic looking machine at the center of the room to reveal its contents.\n\nThose who confessed their sins were blessed with oblivion, the memories of their deeds extracted by the confessional chairs and stored within the digital orbs."
 ancrel.4041.a:0 "How practical."
 ancrel.4041.b:0 "Let us pray for some juicy confessions..."
 ancrel.4041.c:0 "Sacrilege! The bliss of ignorance is not for sinners."
 ancrel.4042.name:0 "Sin"
 ancrel.4042.desc:0 "Sin is unoriginal. The memory orbs contain countless accounts of tedious little transgressions; infidelity, bearing sacrilegious garb, exposing your flappers, adorning your feelers, ingesting your neighbor's pet, child or spouse... The deeds of one penitent alone stand out - those of the priest herself...\n\nThe holo-priest, as it turns out, is a virtual representation of the church's founder, Illuminate Saariah. She appears to have suffered from severe memory loss and was haunted by the conviction that she had committed a heinous act in the past. The tiny molluscoid priest extracted and stored over a hundred of her own confessions in an attempt to figure out what she had done."
 ancrel.4047.name:0 "Forgotten But Not Forgiven"
 ancrel.4047.desc:0 "Illuminate Saariah's work station is littered with obsessive scribbles about a place called Ix Belèn and the horrors she fears transpired there. Judging from her journal she had intermittent moments of clarity followed by complete memory loss. She writes that if she did not recognize her own handwriting she would have thought they were the ramblings of a madwoman. It seems likely that her deteriorating mental health was a side-effect of repeated memory extraction but without a body it is impossible to say.\n\nPiecing together a coherent course of events from her many fragmented confessions has proven as hopeless for the archaeologists as it was for her, but they have uncovered what could be the coordinates to Ix Belèn from one of her many memory orbs."
 ancrel.4047.a:0 "Set course for Ix Belèn."
 ancrel.4047.b:0 "Let the snow bury this unholy establishment. Pray it will soon be forgotten."

 # Archaeological Site 2
 endless_expanse_digsite_2:0 "Ix Belèn"
 endless_expanse_digsite_2_desc:0 "Shrouded within [From.Planet.GetName]'s gaseous atmosphere is the dark looming form of an enormous habitat - the Ix Belèn Residence. Previously a bustling space city where the residents enjoyed a pampered lifestyle with a multitude of comforts made available through technology, the habitat is now a silent tomb. Molluscoid aliens lie slumped across the floor in various states of decay. A postmortem reveals that they died from asphyxiation as the habitat's life support system was disabled, intentionally.\n\nTheir homes are fitted with unusual mechanical chairs that are hooked up to a central database in the shape of a gigantic blue orb - the Memorex."
 ancrel.4043.name:0 "The Memorex"
 ancrel.4043.desc:0 "The inhabitants had developed an enhanced learning program that ran every night as they slept in their mechanical chairs. It was used to remove unpleasant memories and train new skills. Being picked last for spaceball or stood up on a date were little day-to-day horrors the Ix Belènnians did not have to suffer to twice. And for a while it was bliss.\n\nSystematic mind enhancements were mandated by the habitat leadership and distributed to all residents from the Memorex. But the system was exploited. There were clandestine efforts to delete memories and traits collectively from the population without their consent and eventually it backfired. The aliens unlearned important skills for their survival and entered a vegetative state. Shortly thereafter the habitat life support was disabled."
 ancrel.4044.name:0 "Who am I?"
 ancrel.4044.desc:0 "A scan of the habitat's logs reveals its control system was activated again on multiple occasions decades after the life support was disabled. Someone overrode security, entered a maintenance hatch and accessed the Memorex. A datapad and a tiny blue memory orb - a smaller version of the Memorex - lie discarded by the hatch.\n\nThe datapad is filled with the frenzied thoughts of someone on the brink of madness. Again and again the same questions are repeated with growing despair: "who am I? What happened on Ix Belèn?" The final entry reads "now that I know I must forget one last time." Perhaps the orb will reveal what was forgotten."
 ancrel.4045.name:0 "Saariah's Last Memory Orb"
 ancrel.4045.desc:0 "The orb's first memory shows Dr. Saariah spearheading the development of the Memorex to great acclaim. Another memory from years later shows her secretly wiping Memorex data for unknown reasons. Yet another memory is of Saariah working frantically on restoring the residents' memories but to no avail. They stare emptily ahead, heads lolling, all but their autonomic brain functions lost.\n\nFinally admitting defeat she hides the evidence of her crimes. She watches, alone, as the Ix Belèn Residence is pulled into the gravity well of the gas giant it once orbited, feelers secreting large amounts of mucus in what is believed to be an alien expression of great distress."
 ancrel.4046.name:0 "The Temporary Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"
 ancrel.4046.desc:0 "The final memory shows a much older Saariah in a priest's robe waking up in a state of panic, tentacles flailing and ears flapping. She stumbles out of bed and begins to frantically jot down her recollections of yet another nightmare in which empty-eyed aliens convulse on a habitat floor.\n\nThen her face contorts with horror as it dawns upon her that it is all real - the nightmares and the flashbacks are extracted memories coming back to her. And if extracted memories can return, the inhabitants of Ix Belèn could have recovered. The maintenance hatch appears to have opened one last time but Saariah's ship still remains docked at the landing. We could bring the Memorex with us back to [Root.Owner.GetHomeWorldName], if we wish."
