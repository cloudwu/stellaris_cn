 astral_rift_research_lab: "Abandoned Complex"

 astral_rift.2000.name: "Abandoned Facility"
 astral_rift.2000.desc: "We are inside of an abandoned research facility.\n\nThe surfaces in this room are coated in a thick layer of dust, indicating it has not been in use for some time.\n\nWe can detect no researchers, living or otherwise. Whoever the caretakers of this place might have been, they are long since gone.\n\nHeavy-duty shelves line the walls, each holding a large egg. Most of them are in various states of decay, but a few living specimens remain.\n\nAt the center of this chamber rests an open container filled with a pale, viscous liquid. An analysis of the fluid reveals that it contains high amounts of proteins and amino acids. Judging by the residue left on some of the eggs, we speculate this fluid was being injected by the researchers."
 astral_rift.2000.a: "Search for the caretakers."
 astral_rift.2000.b: "Open an egg."

 astral_rift.2010.name: "Quantum Parasites"
 astral_rift.2010.desc: "We have opened the healthiest looking specimen among the eggs.\n\nThe embryo inside appeared malnourished and covered with foreign parasites.\n\nRemarkably, the parasites possess quantum properties unique to any known biological organism. They warp randomly around the inside of the egg's casing, and presumably inside of the embryo itself. Given that so few living eggs remain in this laboratory, this particular specimen must be especially resistant to the parasite's behavior.\n\nAstral tracing of both organisms indicate the parasites originated from a distinct and distant dimension. We believe this parasite was inadvertently summoned here, and has interrupted the intended research of this facility.\n\nWe have seen them drawn to the vat of strange liquid in the center of this chamber. Perhaps this is what attracted them here in the first place."
 astral_rift.2010.a: "Inject the liquid into the egg."
 astral_rift.2010.b: "Euthanize the remaining creatures."

 astral_rift.2015.name: "The Caretakers"
 astral_rift.2015.desc: "We have found the caretakers of this place. More accurately, we have found what remains of them.\n\nA nearby room is littered with corpses. Their limbs have been cleanly separated at the atomic level by some unknown force. Some of the carcasses are half-fused inside of the walls.\n\nA clutch of mostly dissected eggs is present on a central examining table. One of remains intact.\n\nTaking the caretakers' remains back for proper study should provide some insight into what happened here."
 astral_rift.2015.a: "Open an egg."
 astral_rift.2015.b: "Return with the remains."

 astral_rift.2020.name: "Metabolization"
 astral_rift.2020.desc: "Injecting the pale liquid into the exposed embryo has produced some interesting results.\n\nIn spite of the quantum parasites, the previously lethargic specimen has become reinvigorated. In fact, we may have miscalculated the dose. In a very short period of time, a more developed creature began pushing at the walls of the egg - one covered in a lattice of overlapping armored plates and spines.\n\nHowever, the parasites were also stimulated. As they energetically teleport in and out of the embryo, the creature's tissue is being damaged. At this rate, it will likely perish.\n\nWe speculate that injecting a small amount of astral thread may satisfy the quantum parasites and prevent further damage."
 astral_rift.2020.a: "Do not intervene."
 astral_rift.2020.b: "Inject astral thread."

 astral_rift.2025.name: "Euthanized"
 astral_rift.2025.desc: "This creature had no hope of recovery. The parasites infesting its egg are too dangerous to allow propagation beyond this rift.\n\nFollowing strict anti-contamination procedures, we have euthanized all specimens in the vicinity with hydrochloric acid. We are returning with samples for further study."
 astral_rift.2025.a: "A wise choice."

 astral_rift.2030.name: "Biological Instability"
 astral_rift.2030.desc.end: "This volatile quantum infection must have disrupted whatever experiments were meant to be happening in this laboratory.\n\nNonetheless, our observations here have advanced our understanding of biology in extremely unstable conditions."
 astral_rift.2030.desc.default: "The embryo has disintegrated.\n\nAs expected, the parasites in its body soon split it apart in random directions.\n\n$astral_rift.2030.desc.end$"
 astral_rift.2030.desc.injected: "The embryo has disintegrated.\n\nDespite our efforts to stabilize the specimen, the parasites in its body soon split it apart in random directions.\n\n$astral_rift.2030.desc.end$"
 astral_rift.2030.a: "Interesting."

 astral_rift.2035.name: "Biological Weapon"
 astral_rift.2035.desc: "The experiment was a success.\n\nThe astral thread we have injected into the embryo has stabilized the quantum parasites.\n\nThe fully-developed hatchling has emerged intact. It is incredibly obedient and was quick to learn the most basic of commands. Based on that, as well as its thick, armored-hide and poisonous spines, we speculate that these creatures were being bred for war. \n\nStartlingly, it has demonstrated the ability to "warp" small distances. The astral thread seems to have woven a unique symbiotic relationship between the creature and the parasites.\n\nWe may have created something entirely too dangerous."
 astral_rift.2035.desc.exterminator: "$astral_rift.2035.desc$\n\nOur pathetic galaxy is not prepared for what we shall soon unleash upon them."
 astral_rift.2035.desc.non_pacifist: "$astral_rift.2035.desc$\n\nWe're bringing back more."
 astral_rift.2035.a: "Impressive."
 astral_rift.2035.a.tooltip: "Can now build new Assault armies: §H$warpling_army$§!"

 astral_rift.2040.name: "Quantum Parasites"
 astral_rift.2040.desc: "We've completed the harvesting of the researcher's corpses and are transporting them back for further study.\n\nThey were covered with quantum parasites that possess properties unique to any known biological organism. Their ability to unpredictably 'warp' through matter is likely what resulted in the death of their hosts.\n\nAstral tracing of both organisms indicate the parasites originated from a distinct and distant dimension. We believe this parasite was inadvertently summoned here, and has interrupted the intended research of this facility in a devastating fashion.\n\nWe have summarily neutralized the pests with hydrochloric acid to prevent further contamination."
 astral_rift.2040.a: "Fascinating."

 astral_rift.2045.name: "Lethal Exposure"
 astral_rift.2045.desc: "[From.GetName] was found dead. The cause was exposure to the deadly parasites beyond the rift in [FromFrom.solar_system.GetName]. Their quarters are quarantined and awaiting full decontamination."

 astral_rift.2100.name: "Gears and Pinions"
 astral_rift.2100.desc: "We are surrounded by giant machinery.\n\nGears and pinions twist in all directions. Each tenth of a second, the machine clicks one step forward. A single tooth from one of these gears is nearly the width of our §Y$tech_rift_sphere$§!.\n\nAmidst swirling nebulae of dense gas and fog, there is no beginning or end to the device in sight."
 astral_rift.2100.a: "Explore the fog."

 astral_rift.2105.name: "Dimensional Machine"
 astral_rift.2105.desc: "The movement of this dimensional machine is as precise as our most accurate clocks.\n\nThough we have not been able to determine its power source, with some exploring we have found shafts extending into a series of Astral Rifts.\n\nWhatever this place is, it has been made with a purpose in mind. This machine is reaching into many universes. \n\nThe movement of its massive components are creating turbulence in the dense atmosphere, making it difficult to steady our instruments. With some rudimentary manipulation, we could slip one of the shafts loose and use it to jam a pair of the rotating cogs. This would quiet the agitation of the atmosphere, allowing for a more intimate study of this impressive machinery."
 astral_rift.2105.a: "Interfering would be irresponsible."
 astral_rift.2105.b: "Jam the gears."

 astral_rift.2110.name: "If It Ain't Broke..."
 astral_rift.2110.desc: "The architects of this space have knowledge far beyond our own. Interfering with these mechanisms could have wildly unpredictable consequences.\n\nDespite the disruptions from the fog, we have lingered long enough to gain useful engineering insight on the precise construction of this massive machinery, as well as collected a sizable amount of astral material.\n\nWhoever maintains this space must be grand architects indeed."

 astral_rift.2115.name: "Jammed"
 astral_rift.2115.desc: "The gears have jammed.\n\nWith a great shudder, the entire mechanism came to a halt. Our attempt at sabotage was successful.\n\nAs the tension grew, a golden core was exposed under one of the reticulated plates. Glowing and pristine, it will only be accessible for a short time. Inevitably, the growing tension will clear the blockage. We have already begun the delicate process of the core's extraction."
 astral_rift.2115.a: "Use caution."

 astral_rift.2120.name: "Shatter"
 astral_rift.2120.desc: "As we attempted to recover the golden core, a small crack quickly propagated throughout its surface. Before we could complete its retrieval, it exploded violently forth in all directions.\n\nAs it shattered, it released an intense energy. Overcoming our blockage, the massive gears around us began spinning wildly out of control.\n\nWe have activated the emergency anchor cable to escape this unfortunate situation."

 astral_rift.2125.name: "Success"
 astral_rift.2125.desc: "We have recovered the golden core of one of the mechanisms.\n\nThe surrounding gears now lay oddly silent. All tension around us has been relieved.\n\nThe network of Astral Rifts connected to this device have visibly ceased their subtle movements, as if stopped in time. Of what consequence this is, we cannot be sure.\n\nWe have safely retracted our anchor cable and left this space. The recovered core has remarkable temporal properties which we are only beginning to understand."

 astral_rift.2200.name: "Floating Body"
 astral_rift.2200.desc: "We are surrounded by garbage.\n\nFrom time to time, we have witnessed new tears in space open around us and dump even more garbage into the swirling heap. Based on the nature of the debris, this space is being treated as a junkyard for a star-faring civilization. Parts and pieces of unknown machines are littered amongst the everyday disposables of alien households.\n\nGenerally, these items are of no greater value than scrap. However, our sensors have picked up signs of life.\n\nInside of a spacesuit, the unconscious body of an unknown organism lies dormant. It is unclear how long it has been floating here."
 astral_rift.2200.a: "Bring it aboard and give aid."
 astral_rift.2200.b: "Bring it aboard to recover its gear."

 astral_rift.2205.name: "Floating Body"
 astral_rift.2205.common.1: "Taking in the alien found floating within the garbage was a mistake."

 astral_rift.2210.common.2: "We have had time to analyze the documents it held in its gear. Early translations of its identifications indicate it was a veteran trash hauler. It must have accidentally dumped itself into this garbage heap along with its load, never to return home.\n\nIgnoring the creature for now, we will be remaining the rift until we have finished identifying and recovering as much valuable scrap as possible."

 astral_rift.2210.a: "Unfortunate for them."

 astral_rift.2215.name: "De-escalation"
 astral_rift.2215.desc: "Demonstrating our peaceful intentions, we laid down our weapons. The alien released its grip on our [Explorer.GetCrewMember] and dropped their weapon in return. It appears to be in a highly emotional state, as is to be expected under the current circumstances.\n\nGiven some time to calm down, it became receptive to our communications.\n\nWe have begun the process of finding a way to hold a proper conversation. Progress has been slow, but early translations of the documents found in its possession indicate the alien is hundreds of years old."
 astral_rift.2215.a: "Excellent."

 astral_rift.2220.name: "Fatalities Sustained"
 astral_rift.2220.desc: "Before we could neutralize the hostile alien, it dispatched their hostage and several others with a powerful plasma pistol drawn from their boot.\n\nUnfortunately, [Leader.GetName] was among the list of casualties.\n\nWe are pulling emergency anchor and returning with the wounded.\n\nWe have taken the time to analyze the spacesuit of the recovered alien. It is constructed of a highly advanced alloy which should prove useful."

 astral_rift.2715.desc: "Our sample confirmed the presence of microorganisms within the wind.\n\nAs an experiment, we synthesized a similar hormone and released it into the surrounding atmosphere. Suddenly, the brutal winds transformed into a much gentler current.\n\nFurther analysis of the sample indicated that, in large enough clusters, these microorganisms comprise a single mind. Working together, they are able to generate "living" gusts of wind.\n\nSome of these currents carry hair-like strands of genetic material. Caught in the same current, we were pushed back toward the surface where the storm had now subsided."
 astral_rift.2715.a: "Follow the living wind."

 astral_rift.2720.name: "Among the Fungus"
 astral_rift.2720.desc: "Tapping into the network's mycelial synapses, we issued a short current; every mushroom cap stiffened suddenly, obviously bewildered by a new actor on their internal network. We received a frenzy of signals in response, but eventually we managed to decipher the fungus' transmission.\n\nThe organism is a hive mind that views itself as the custodian of the planet's native species. Beneath the surface, all manner of flora and fauna are preserved and protected by the mycelial clusters. In exchange, the fungus consumes their waste as sustenance.\n\nHowever, a threat exists to this symbiotic relationship, and to the continued survival of the fungus itself."
 astral_rift.2720.a: "Maintain fungal correspondence."

 astral_rift.2725.name: "Fungal Threat"
 astral_rift.2725.desc: "We reached the planet's surface, over which hovered a thick layer of yellow clouds. While the landscape was level and mostly bare, every hidden cavity and crevice harbored clusters of spore-spewing fungi.\n\nThe air currents we followed here flowed over the landscape, releasing bundles of hairy, air borne spawn. These floated down towards the surface, where most were quickly disintegrated by the blanket of fungal spores.\n\nWhat little spawn survived attached itself to the bare terrain and formed a conical polyp, providing a protected environment for the wind borne microorganisms to safely mature.\n\nClearly, the fungal spores are preventing the wind creatures from reproducing. In turn, the wind creatures have leveled the planet's surface, forcing the fungus to retreat to the most sheltered environments."
 astral_rift.2725.a: "Find a way to remove the fungus."
 astral_rift.2725.b: "Investigate the fungus."

 astral_rift.2730.name: "Carnivorous Winds"
 astral_rift.2730.desc: "The fungus guided us back to the cave entrance, where the storm had subsided. A small, reptilian creature hesitated at the threshold before crossing into the open wastes. Almost immediately, a sharp current of wind scooped the reptile into the air.\n\nWe could do nothing but watch as it was sliced into smaller and smaller pieces, only to be digested by enzymes in the air.\n\nOutside of the sanctuary maintained by the fungus, life on the surface is at the mercy of the carnivorous wind. Given its brutal accuracy and responsiveness, it is safe to assume the wind is at least somewhat sentient.\n\nAnd hungry."
 astral_rift.2730.a: "Protect the ecosystem against the wind."
 astral_rift.2730.b: "Study the wind."

 astral_rift.2735.name: "Fungal Transmission"
 astral_rift.2735.desc: "Traveling along the surface of the planet, we approached a cluster of the spore-emitting fungus. A tissue sample revealed that it is a highly complex hive mind. By transmitting rapid electrical impulses between nodes, it communicates across an intricate network.\n\nTapping into the network's mycelial synapses, we issued a short current; every mushroom cap stiffened suddenly, obviously bewildered by a new actor on their internal network. We received a frenzy of signals in response, the meaning of which remains unclear."
 astral_rift.2735.a: "Decipher the fungal transmission."

 astral_rift.2740.name: "Current Events"
 astral_rift.2740.desc: "After exiting the cave, we measured the strong gusts of wind circling our vessel. We detected a hormone-like compound in the surrounding air and analyzed it.\n\nThe hormones are similar to those released by certain plants under threat. We have also confirmed the presence of a species of microorganism, which we hypothesize is controlling the wind. As an experiment, we synthesized a similar hormone and released it into the atmosphere."
 astral_rift.2740.a: "Continue the investigation."

 astral_rift.2745.name: "The Case for the Fungus"
 astral_rift.2745.desc.common: "After deciphering the fungus' transmission, it is now clear that the wind creatures are destroying the planet's ecosystem. As the living wind scours the surface for food, it eradicates the biodiversity the fungus relies on to survive.\n\nThe fungus guided us to an underground cave where hundreds of species of plants, animals, and insects have been sheltered from the forceful winds."

 astral_rift.2750.desc.common: "The harsh winds subsided soon after we released the hormone.\n\nA light breeze passed over our vessel, releasing a bundle of hairy, airborne spawn. These floated down towards the surface, where most were quickly disintegrated by the blanket of fungal spores.\n\nWhen the surviving spawn did reach the ground, it attached itself to the bare terrain and formed a conical polyp, providing a protected environment for the wind borne microorganisms to safely mature.\n\nWe concluded that the wind was demonstrating how the fungus is attempting to thwart their reproductive processes."

 astral_rift.2755.name: "Cutting Winds"
 astral_rift.2755.desc: "We provided the wind creatures with a large quantity of alloyed metal filings. These abrasives were light enough to be swept along individual currents but strong enough to wear away most minerals over a short time.\n\nA group of air currents quickly used these filings to shred a cluster of yellow fungus sheltering inside a nearby crevice.\n\nThe wind creatures went on to distribute the metal filings more broadly among themselves. Sharp winds began to strike at the planet's surface, targeting the spore-spewing fungus in a coordinated bombardment.\n\nIn what was perhaps a gesture of gratitude, a gentle breeze delivered us a bundle of its hairy, floating spawn. With these, we can foster our own "living winds", bringing high-velocity air currents to a select group of our colonies."

 astral_rift.2760.name: "Fungal Bloom"
 astral_rift.2760.desc: "We distributed a large quantity of mineral nutrients across the planet's surface, and introduced new wind-resistant plant life to the reinvigorated soil. The fungus was then able to spread a huge quantity of spores on the newly-fertile land.\n\nExisting fungal clusters are already growing in size and resilience. Over time, the fungus should creep along the entire surface of the planet, starving-out the propagations of the wind.\n\nIts nodes bursting with a new-found strength, the fungus transmitted a message of gratitude along its mycelial network.\n\nA previously undiscovered fungal specimen then sprouted from the ground near our location. Its bulbous cavities were inflated with high concentrations of exotic gasses. We are confident that cultivating these "puffballs" will aid us in the production of this valuable resource."

 astral_rift.2765.name: "A Difficult Compromise"
 astral_rift.2765.desc: "The extreme differences in communication between the fungus and the wind creatures resulted in an arduous, complex discussion. However, we have brokered an agreement between the two species.\n\nSo long as they do not disturb existing spore clusters, the wind creatures will have the right to hunt and breed on designated portions of the planet's surface. Meanwhile, the fungal hive mind has been granted an equal part of the landscape where they can spread their spores without fear, hosting the myriad of other species beneath their protective network.\n\nUnder this arrangement, the planet's unique ecosystem has a new opportunity to prosper. We have installed observation satellites to keep tabs on its progress from beyond the rift."

 astral_rift.2770.name: "Biological Eradication"
 astral_rift.2770.desc: "This quarrel between these [Explorer.GetPreFTLLower] species has become tiresome.\n\nWe synthesized a potent acid and aerosolized it within the planet's atmosphere. As the caustic agent spread, the wind creatures dissolved into dust and the fungus shriveled and blackened. We were able to exploit existing compounds within the planet's atmosphere to cascade this effect across the entire world.\n\nAfter confirming that the planet had been fully euthanized, we picked it clean of all useful material."
 astral_rift.2770.a: "Well done."

Another wormhole appeared high above the crowd, ejecting the performer who deftly tumbled to the ground.\n\nThe other performers followed suit, weaving and catching one another in complex patterns through an ever-shifting series of wormholes. The crowd gasped as one of the acrobats slipped into a portal, severing a limb from their body as the wormhole closed. Just as they were about to hit the ground, the wounded performer disappeared through yet another wormhole.\n\nThe severed arm dropped from the rafters, grabbing a trapeze as it fell and flinging itself into the air.

A many-tentacled robot, a bipedal entity, and a living tangle of thick vines were brought to the stage. These creatures then willingly jumped into the reptilian cyborg's mouth, allowing themselves to be deftly juggled in the same manner.\n\nThe mechanical beast then held the three volunteers in its mouth and squatted, compressing itself against the floor. Its huge frame glowed a molten orange. Once the process was complete, the performer opened its mouth and only a single creature walked out. It had the bulbous head of the tentacled robot, the torso of the toxoid, and thick limbs made of intertwined vines. It gestured to the crowd, evoking a stunned silence.\n\nThe cyborg then re-ingested the biological amalgam and spat out the three individuals once again, good as new.

However, this was only a setup to the true performance.\n\nThe creature's movements began to slowly decelerate, to the point at which time itself began to reverse. Its figure traced back along the arc of its previous jump and froze in mid-air. This brought the crowd to life.\n\nSuddenly, the stasis was broken. The creature returned to the ground and began to transform. Its body changed from featureless gray stone to sparkling red crystal, free-flowing sand, brittle blue shale, and more. It continued to perform an ever more complicated series of contortions.\n\nAt the height of its performance, it burst into thousands of prismatic shards. These froze mid-air in an intricate arrangement, refracting the stage's simple spotlight into a complex display of incredible colors and patterns.\n\nThe shards slowly rewound until the performer was returned whole, and the creature left the stage to an unmatched roar from the crowd."

Whatever negative health effects this may have, it allows members of the species to manipulate wormholes in natural fashion. This discovery will revolutionize our understanding of genetics and the marvelous potential of biological life."

 astral_rift.2965.desc: "We were able to meet the acrobats in a more personal capacity, helped in part by our significant donation. The performers were very appreciative and demonstrated a variety of impressive parlor tricks involving micro-wormholes - from slicing small objects in half to creating an infinitely looping set of paired portals.\n\nWe were able to document this unique phenomenon for further study, and are confident these demonstrations will greatly deepen our understanding of hyperspace technology. Admittedly, the casual nature with which they approach such dangerous physics was alarming to witness."

 astral_rift.2970.name: "Unorthodox Sample Collection"
 astral_rift.2970.desc.common: "In our attempts to surreptitiously gather a small piece of the reptilian cyborg's tissue, we angered the creature. It subsequently vomited a wave of viscous, green slime onto our away team and we were escorted out of the facility by security drones."
 astral_rift.2970.desc.organic: "$astral_rift.2970.desc.common$\n\nStrangely enough, the slime was observed to have remarkable healing properties on our [leader.species.GetSkinType]. Small wounds and abrasions cleanly knitted themselves whole and left behind a pleasant sensation. This biologically dense fluid could be used as a solvent for a variety of medicinal and curative therapies."
 astral_rift.2970.desc.inorganic: "$astral_rift.2970.desc.common$\n\nThe viscous fluid was dense with biological material, and seems suitable for use as a basis for a highly nutritious food gel. We are using its properties to develop a similar alimentary paste out of organic waste which should vastly increase the efficiency of our food production systems."

 astral_rift.2975.desc: "We were able to meet the massive cyborg in a more personal capacity, helped in part by our significant donation of food.\n\nThe wide-mouthed creature was uncharacteristically enthusiastic and turned itself around in excitement. It spent many minutes completing this 360 degree spin, allowing us an in-depth cataloging of its cyborg's cybernetic enhancements and support systems.\n\nFrom our analysis, we were able to determine that they had once been a fraction of its current size as a typical sapient reptilian species and owes most of its mass to their augmentations. Given the huge number of upgrades in various conditions of oxidation, this individual must have been alive for centuries."

 astral_rift.2980.name: "Biological Crystallization"
 astral_rift.2980.desc: "Pushing ourselves through the crowds, we were able to investigate the contortionist more closely.\n\nThey displayed for us one of their heavy stone arms, effortlessly transforming it into a cluster of different minerals. What began as coarse granite shifted into dull red gemstones, and finally sparkling crystals. The shifting of the material sent fine particles of dust into the air, which we were quick to secure as a sample.\n\nThe samples contain a volatile biological substance that can be used to spontaneously crystallize certain minerals under very specific conditions. The use of this material on a large scale could be leveraged into our existing mineral production and achieve similar effects."

 astral_rift.2985.name: "Quantum Mineralization"
 astral_rift.2985.desc: "We were able to meet the contortionist in a more personal capacity, helped in part by our significant donation.\n\nThe material of this creature did not seem wholly bound to this reality. On closer inspection, it shared with us how it could shift the magnetic alignments of its composite materials in such a way that small openings into other dimensions formed just long enough to literally swap its own atoms out with those from another time and place. With such quantum realignments, it is difficult to know if this being is the same as we encountered only hours ago.\n\nWhile such an ability does make for an impressive performance, we shudder to think what an entire civilization of this species could achieve. It has been a valuable research opportunity, nonetheless."
