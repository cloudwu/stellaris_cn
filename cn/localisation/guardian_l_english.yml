 guardian.310.name:0 "The Outrage"
 guardian.310.desc:0 "The Festival of Worlds organized by the Artisan Troupe has brought joy to the people of [Root.GetName]. Alas, it was not meant to last.\nOn [this_planet.GetName] the festival activities resulted in a huge crowd stampeding and killing thousands of citizens."

 guardian.321.desc:0 "Here follows the latest newsletter for all our patrons:\n\n"
 guardian.321.desc.a:0 "Sadly nothing much has been produced in the enclave. Most of the artists have fallen into a deep melancholy from where no inspiration can be drawn. The mood is dire, but hopeful. Creation takes time after all.\n\nAny donations that might help the group rekindle their interest in the material plane again would be of tremendous help."
 guardian.321.desc.b:0 "The enclave has been busy the last couple of months. The halls are abuzz with a new kind of technology invented by a resident, capable of transmitting sensations of smell into a user. This remarkable piece of machinery will surely change everything.\n\nIn order to further develop this idea we will require more donations."
 guardian.321.desc.c:0 "The enclave is in a frisky mood. The creation of the Scentilus Rift has caused many an artist to change their primary focus to creating new experiences for it. So far the most noteworthy to come out of this endeavor is an orchestral piece conveyed via scent.\n\nOur work continues and any donations would be gladly accepted."
 guardian.321.desc.d:0 "We have abandoned the attempts to create scent-centered media. It was a foolish idea and has brought nothing but wasted time and unpleasant odors.\n\nIn order to find our way back again we will need donations from our trusted patrons. We thank you for your continued support!"
 guardian.321.a:0 "We would like to donate"
 guardian.321.a.reply:0 "We joyously accept your donation and promise that it will be used in the most creative of endeavors!"

 guardian.322.name:0 "Patrons with Benefits"
 guardian.322.desc:0 "Greetings, patron [Root.GetRulerName]! We have come up with a gorgeous new type of architecture, specifically tuned to improve crowds' understanding of one another. It functions thanks to a mix of using the populace's subconscious bias against each other and art, while then smashing it all and presenting a new form of unity.\n\nWould you like to purchase this building? It will surely prove useful to binding your empire together. And it's a bargain, if I may say so myself:\n§R£energy  -1000\n§R£minerals  -1000"

 guardian.324.a.reply:0 "That is good, then it won't go to waste."
 guardian.324.b:0 "We will repair it for you."

 guardian.333.desc:0 "We received a distress signal from the headmaster of the Artisan Troupe. Their last station and cultural haven has been destroyed. There were few survivors, and the troupe is essentially no more."
 guardian.334.desc:0 "After having destroyed the Artisan Troupe's station we found many resources to salvage from the wreckage. Donations, gifts and creations stacked in its halls, now drifting in space, ready for the taking."
 guardian.334.desc.unknown:0 "After having destroyed that random station floating in the [station_system.GetName] system, we have found plenty of valuable resources among the remains."

 guardian.515.b:0 "Can the fortress be entered?"
 guardian.515.b.reply:0 "It can and it has, although that attempt is now nearly forgotten. The fortress can be partially powered while in shutdown, although it will attempt to use whatever power is sent into it to jump-start its full systems. Proceed with caution."
 guardian.515.c:0 "Who built the fortress?"
 guardian.515.c.reply:0 "Whoever they were, they must have been fond of puzzles and enigmas. The only items recovered from the fortress in the past are metal shapes used in contraptions inside, to be rearranged to some satisfactory solutions. Those who brought them back did so because they failed and barely escaped with their lives. Many others didn't."
 guardian.515.d:0 "How is the fortress powered?"
 guardian.515.d.reply:0 "The power system must have been built at some point between the initial construction of the hull and the setup of the defense systems. Its recovery method is unknown, but we have discovered that the fortress contains large quantities of dark matter. That substance and its relationship to black holes is key to understanding how the fortress has lasted so long.\n\nNo one has ever found the source of its power, but it is likely to be extremely volatile."

It roams the galaxy, submerging itself into stars, feasting on them from within. And it certainly does not like being disturbed."
 guardian.520.a.reply:0 "The star-feaster is a rare breed. A new type of beast of unknown origin. The accounts we have collected are few and sparse with intel. Few sources even have firsthand experience with the thing.\n\nAll our data points to the same fact, however: it is a terror that brings nothing but ruin.\n\nThe Stellar Devourer is capable of feeding off of fusion itself. Our §Yvery§! educated guess is that its biology is the result of some outer-dimensional fusing of dark matter and solar matter. It dives into stars, feasting on their innards in order to fuel its own, internal fusion reactor. It brings death to all systems it reaches. Either they shatter like ice after its banquet, or they burn from being exposed to a second sun from within the being's belly.\n\nIt wants to feed, and it will stop at nothing to get its share. When you gaze at it, what you see is a survivor's raw fury."
 guardian.520.b.reply:0 "The only thing we know for sure is that the collected core is the most important aspect of the Stellar Devourer. The creature desperately needs to keep its furnace burning, lest the cold void of space reaches its vital organs deeper within and makes it collapse in on itself. Without that stellar matter, it is nothing.\n\nYou can use this to your advantage. Calibrate your weapons to our specifications and you can then home in on the very membranes that hold the Devourer's digestive system together. Wound it and you will see its innards gush out across the solar system."

No hacker or engineer in the entire galaxy has been able to see through its shiny exterior to gain a glimpse of the knowledge it so obviously withholds from us. We are at a loss. We neither know what it is for, nor what it aims to do once it's done."
 guardian.535.b.reply:0 "There is perhaps one thing you could do to destroy it. We have been unable to retrieve information from it, but its hull is breakable. Miners have tried to gather resources from it at numerous times, only to come back with their ships barely holding together. But they did find something interesting: The Infinity Machine is not as rigid as it seems.\n\nIt is made of a material capable of changing its characteristics. Density, flexibility, heat, you name it! It can analyze damage in real time and change its shell to compensate, thus making itself harder to take down. Change your frequencies, adjust the thermal output of your missiles, whatever you people lumber around with, and keep changing them. That way you can get past its adaptive capabilities."

Dark matter is funneled around the fortress and then back to the core, like a cardiovascular system. Although the flow has stopped, the team has found signs that it's starting again. We can take all the time we want to study it, but it needs to be stopped now."
