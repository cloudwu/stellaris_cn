ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_friendly:0 "It is to the credit of both our great empires that we stand together when necessary."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_friendly_0:0 "Ah, the $COUNTRY$! It is rare to find someone worthy of our respect in this alien cesspool."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_friendly_1:0 "We do not enjoy asking for the support of outsiders, but the $COUNTRY$ are considered friends."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_friendly_2:0 "It is unsettling to be here amongst all these xenos, but any representative from the $COUNTRY$ is to be considered a friend."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_friendly_3:0 "Finally, someone sensible! This place is infested with the vilest xenos imaginable, but it is always pleasant to meet with representatives of the $COUNTRY$."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_friendly_4:0 "Let us work together to put this Galactic Community back on the right track."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_neutral:0 "Just support us in this, and then we will gladly leave you alone."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_neutral_0:0 "We propose the following: you support us in the upcoming vote, and then you leave us alone. Are you in agreement?"
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_neutral_1:0 "Being surrounded by all these... creatures... is a terrible strain, so please don't make me beg for your support."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_neutral_2:0 "We shall see what good can come of a place like this, where aliens are free to intermingle and spread disease. For now, we will make the best of it."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_neutral_3:0 "The $GREETER$ proposes this resolution, assuming the other empires of the galaxy can be trusted to adhere to its articles."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_neutral_4:0 "Perhaps there is some merit to working with aliens instead of shunning them. We shall see."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_hostile:0 "The faster you support us, the faster we can go our separate ways."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_hostile_0:0 "Let us make something crystal clear: the $GREETER$ does not need your help. However, we would not necessarily be averse to your support in the upcoming vote..."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_hostile_1:0 "My government has ordered me to ask for your assistance in the upcoming vote. Now please excuse me while I seek out the nearest sanitation chamber."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_hostile_2:0 "This so-called "community" is an alien farce, but we shall play our part... for now."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_hostile_3:0 "If this resolution fails, we will have definite proof that all other alien species are conspiring against us."
ADD ethic_xenophobe_request_hostile_4:0 "Never before have I seen so many... unseemly creatures gathered in one place. This Galactic Community is truly something."
ADD ethic_materialist_request_friendly:0 "The $GREETER$ has full confidence in the ability of the $COUNTRY$ to make well-informed and reasonable decisions."
ADD ethic_materialist_request_friendly_0:0 "We know better than to squabble over arbitrary concepts like ideology and superstition. Join us in the upcoming vote."

ADD ethic_materialist_request_friendly_3:0 "With the support of our friends in the $COUNTRY$, this resolution has a much greater probability of success."
ADD ethic_materialist_request_friendly_4:0 "It is the duty of our two great empires to prevent the Galactic Community's slow descent into ignorance and superstition."
ADD ethic_materialist_request_neutral:0 "Isn't it nice to have things? For instance, in the upcoming vote; can we have your support?"
ADD ethic_materialist_request_neutral_0:0 "Look at this in practical terms. Support us in this vote, and perhaps we will return the favor one day."
ADD ethic_materialist_request_neutral_1:0 "To vote in our favor is to vote in favor of an enlightened galaxy. What could be more important?"
ADD ethic_materialist_request_neutral_2:0 "This resolution will yield the greatest benefits to the galaxy as a whole. It is a mathematical certainty."
ADD ethic_materialist_request_neutral_3:0 "Please help the $COUNTRY$ in its efforts to usher in an age of reason for the galaxy."

ADD ethic_spiritualist_request_neutral_2:0 "We are but vessels of something far greater than ourselves."

ADD ethic_spiritualist_request_hostile:0 "Lose those shackles of materialism and want. Support us and your path to wisdom shall become clear."
ADD ethic_spiritualist_request_hostile_0:0 "The $COUNTRY$ flounders in darkness, but may still find its way back to the light. The first step is to support us in the upcoming vote."
ADD ethic_spiritualist_request_hostile_1:0 "Despite your many previous blunders, we pray that the $COUNTRY$ will recognize the true path to follow in the upcoming vote."
ADD ethic_spiritualist_request_hostile_2:0 "The fates have conspired to bring about a situation where we are... compelled... to ask for your support."
ADD ethic_spiritualist_request_hostile_3:0 "Salvation may not have slipped entirely out of your grasp just yet. If you support this resolution, there could still be hope..."
ADD ethic_spiritualist_request_hostile_4:0 "Will the $COUNTRY$ finally make an attempt to mend its profane ways? It is not too late for you."
ADD ethic_hivemind_request_friendly:0 "Are we not bound to act in unison? Is there any other way?\n\nNo, really - is there?"
ADD ethic_hivemind_request_friendly_0:0 "The $GREETER$ looks forward to the prospect of enjoying the support of the $COUNTRY$."
ADD ethic_hivemind_request_friendly_1:0 "Will the $COUNTRY$ support us in the upcoming vote, and spare us the unpleasantness of discord?"
ADD ethic_hivemind_request_friendly_2:0 "In many ways, we view the $GREETER$ as an extension of ourselves.\n\nWe mean this in a good way."

ADD ethic_hivemind_request_neutral_2:0 "Discord must be avoided. Support this resolution, or you risk destabilizing the Galactic Community."
ADD ethic_hivemind_request_neutral_3:0 "This method of reaching consensus by consulting each individual component of the Galactic Community seems... highly inefficient and time-consuming."
ADD ethic_hivemind_request_neutral_4:0 "The Mind requires your obedi... support in this matter of galactic interest."
ADD ethic_hivemind_request_hostile:0 "A vote against the $GREETER$ is to delay the inevitable. What would be the point in that?"
