# introduction event
 progress.2.desc.wilderness: "The [Root.GetName] has made a startling find on [from.GetName]: the [from.GetPlanetMoon] is teeming with alien life! For the first time, we have encountered lifeforms which originated outside our self.\n\nThis discovery finally confirms that we, the planet [root.owner.capital_scope.GetName], are not alone in the universe. Although none of the alien creatures found on [from.GetName] are sapient, it is likely only a matter of time before we encounter beings that are..."

# Colonization Events
 wilderness.1010.name: "[from.GetName] Awakens"
 wilderness.1010.desc.intro: "Our terraforming spores have fulfilled their purpose, delivering a part of our self to colonize an alien world for the first time."
 wilderness.1010.desc.same: "Becoming [from.GetName] as well as [root.GetHomeWorldName]... It already feels so familiar to us: a comfortable way of being, despite taking on so many new forms under a once-alien sun. We have adapted easily to the pre-existing conditions here." #e.g. 'becoming Mars as well as Earth...''
 wilderness.1010.desc.similar_cold: "Adapting our self to suit [from.GetClassAdj] §Y[from.GetName]§! will have its challenges, but we have already found familiar ways to cope. Tendrils extend, habitats are carved out, and hungry mouths hunt." #e.g. 'Adapting our self to suit arctic Pluto...'
 wilderness.1010.desc.similar_dry: "As the planet [root.GetHomeWorldName], we have always thrived in parched atmosphere. So too shall we rise to the challenge of becoming [from.GetClassAdj] §Y[from.GetName]§!. Already we have found new ways to seek and conserve moisture, and learned to work with this challenging new geology, rather than against it." #e.g. 'the challenge of becoming savannah Mars'
 wilderness.1010.desc.similar_wet: "Just as we thrived in and amongst the waters of [root.GetHomeWorldName], so too shall we flourish as [from.GetClassAdj] §Y[from.GetName]§!. The minerals, the currents, and even the amount of daylight we receive feel strange here, but we have already found ways to extract what we need." #e.g. 'we flourish as oceanic Neptune'
 wilderness.1010.desc.diff_cold: "We knew that becoming §Y[from.GetName]§! would be challenging. Indeed, some of what made us the [root.capital_scope.GetClassAdj] planet [root.GetHomeWorldName] has already withered away here, but what remains is strong, and has begun to adapt. This unfamiliar environment makes acquiring basic, life-sustaining resources all the more difficult - but clinging to this frigid landscape, we observe that life has already found a way." #e.g. 'becoming Earth'
 wilderness.1010.desc.diff_dry: "This place evokes a primal fear for us: so hot and dry that it awakens instinctive memories of The Scorch. If we can adapt and thrive here, though... Becoming §Y[from.GetName]§! may awaken something new in ourselves, too. Where moisture exists, we have found ways to store it. Where shade was scarce, we have found ways to provide our own."
 wilderness.1010.desc.diff_wet: "Our effort to become §Y[from.GetName]§! will be challenging, but we have braced our self against rot and deluge. Those parts of us more capable of handling water now wick it away for those which are more vulnerable. We have embraced the unique currents of this place." #e.g. 'Our effort to become Mars'
 wilderness.1010.desc.other: "As we shape ourselves to become §Y[from.GetName]§!, we identify those parts of our self which will thrive, and which will wither. This [from.GetClassAdj] existence shares much in common with what we have known before, but also much that is strange - so we observe, and we experiment." #e.g. 'shape ourselves to become Luna'
 wilderness.1010.desc.outro: "Our superstructures, our nutrients and our very DNA have begun adapting and mingling with the life that existed here before us. [from.GetName] is waking up."
 wilderness.1010.a: "Soon our worlds shall become one."

# Terraforming Events
 terra.25.desc.wilderness: "Our lengthy project to awaken §Y[From.GetName]§! has not resolved as successfully as we had hoped. A rupture in one of our biomass realigners has released a minor deluge of §YTerraforming Residue§!, clogging valleys and forming a sticky crust over certain habitable zones.\n\nWhile not inherently dangerous to us, this excess of pus-like material means some of our more motile elements may struggle for a time."
 terra.80.desc.wilderness: "We have freed our future selves from another layer of radiation in the atmosphere and soil of §Y[From.GetName]§!. However, our watchful [Root.GetTerraformerPlural] had to intervene and have temporarily isolated part of this world. We appear to have disturbed an extremely elusive native species that thrives in radioactive environments. Unfortunately, due to our actions, it has begun to wilt.\n\nEven more curiously, this species appears to be presapient: they are on the cusp of achieving independent thought. Now, as [From.GetName] is poised to purge the last of its hazardous environmental legacy, we must decide how to handle this novel form of life."
 terra.80.b.wilderness: "This world is theirs. We should let them awaken."
 terra.80.d.wilderness: "Let us consume them."

 wilderness.2000.name: "A Planned Awakening"
 #wilderness.2000.desc.reg: "We feel the tremendous potential of [from.GetName]. It seems proper to both fear and delight in the awesome power we are about to exert there: shaping this [from.GetPlanetMoon] with our will and the tools we have developed; laying the pattern for its eventual awakening.\n\nWe have long relied on natural processes to grow and sustain the [root.GetName]. But these trials also cost us dearly, and taught us much. Now we shall see what wonders emerge when a habitable world skips its own evolution and gains the wisdom of hard-earned growth and decay."
 wilderness.2000.desc.barren: "The desolation of [from.GetName] is perhaps painful to witness, but not for much longer. Life in this galaxy has so far seen fit to ignore this barren world, but now we, the [root.GetName], wield the tools and knowledge to amend this.\n\nDespite all we have learned so far, we face a daunting task in the restoration of [from.GetName]. By our will, and with the climate-altering tools we have discovered, life shall soon exist where previously there was none."
 wilderness.2000.desc.tomb_detox: "Though life as we know it on [from.GetName] may have been snuffed out, we are now primed to give the world a second chance. We have begun the work of restoring its atmosphere, watercourses, and soil so that [from.GetName] may once again host life in the form of the [root.GetName]."
 wilderness.2000.desc.gaia: "The crucible of evolution has made wonders of us, the [root.GetName]. Now though, we have the opportunity to impart so much more for the [from.GetPlanetMoon] [from.GetName]. Wielding tools and knowledge our earlier self could scarcely conceive of, we have begun shaping [from.GetName] into a place whose awakening is sure to be unlike any other.\n\nThe foundations of [from.GetName] shall one day teem with nutrients, refreshed by the vibrant life cycles of our flora and fauna. Valleys, ridges and plateaux will offer bountiful space for foraging, hunting and shelter. Life shall flourish here."
 wilderness.2000.a: "Let us begin."

Yet the stars have long been restless.\n\nA battle took place in the skies above [root.GetHomeWorldName]. Great vessels rained debris upon its surface - alien artifacts that were quickly repurposed. Then came the superflare..."
