 bio.115.name: "Generational Redundancy"
 bio.115.desc: "As we introduce a new biological template for our drones, we must decide how to handle those incompatible with the genetic upgrade.\n\nSome older drones lack the strength to endure the alterations. We could either retain them as labor for the remainder of their lifespan, or recycle their biomatter to replenish the hive."
 bio.115.a: "Recycle the old drones."
 bio.115.b: "They are still useful."

 bio.120.name: "Speed or Stamina"
 bio.120.desc: "A breakthrough in genetic research has revealed a way to enhance neural relay efficiency, significantly boosting [target.GetIndividualName] productivity.\n\nHowever, this increase in brain output is not sustainable over a long period, leading to a shorter lifespan.\n\nWe must decide whether to retain our regular lifespans or develop heightened functioning at the cost of longevity."

 bio.125.desc: "A batch of newly augmented [target.GetIndividualNamePlural] has been integrated into the [target.GetGestaltEntityName], their biological engineering fine-tuned to accelerate neural development and cognitive processes. The [target.GetGestaltEntityName]'s key synaptic nodes are now operating at an unprecedented pace.\n\nYet, this acceleration has strained the [target.GetIndividualName]'s stability, risking catastrophic synaptic overload. Alternatively, we could reallocate more [target.GetIndividualNamePlural] to coordination tasks."
 bio.125.a: "Slow down and maintain stability."
 bio.125.b: "Live fast and burn brightly."

 bio.130.name: "Frequency Phenomena"
 bio.130.desc: "Since integrating a new batch of clones into our hive, we have observed unpleasant audio-vibratory issues. A misstep in the cloning process may have stunted the development of their biological transmitters, causing frequency interference.\n\nWhen these clones commune with the wider hive, all nearby drones are subjected to loud and unsettling bouts of mental tinnitus. Distractions are high, and productivity is at risk."
 bio.130.a: "Unpleasant, but not intolerable."
 bio.130.b: "Cull the offending clones."

 bio.135.name: "A Moving Problem"
 bio.135.desc: "Recent Cloning experiments have yielded unusual results. Some clones appear to be neurologically linked to their genetic donors, causing them to unintentionally move in tandem.\n\nThe phenomenon persists no matter the distance, with individual drones mirroring the actions of their counterparts elsewhere in the galaxy. This presents some intriguing possibilities.\n\nWe could implement an initiative that brings clones and donors together to work in tandem in identical environments. Alternatively, we could extract the responsible neurotransmitters to better study the phenomenon."
 bio.135.a: "Set up identical workstations for donor and clone."
 bio.135.b: "Surgically sever the synchronous links."

 bio.140.name: "Incompatible Clones"
 bio.140.desc: "In an attempt to bolster the hive, we cultivated a batch of clones from donor material and artificially accelerated their maturity. Though fine biological specimens, these clones are incompatible.\n\nThis deviation, while troubling, presents a unique opportunity. These individuated drones, now possessing singular identities and independent thought, may prove advantageous in interfacing with entities outside the collective. Their ability to think autonomously could bridge gaps where the hive's unified voice struggles to adapt. Yet, these benefits come at a cost: their growing awareness of individuality has led to unrest, affecting some of our higher-level cognitive functions."
 bio.140.a: "Force the integration."
 bio.140.b: "Utilize their potential."

 bio.145.name: "Creation Concerns"
 bio.145.desc: "Our collective consciousness is in turmoil. We now possess the ability to create copies of ourselves, yet we hesitate, questioning the efficacy (and even the morality) of such actions.\n\nCloning processes require significant resources. Might these be better spent elsewhere, particularly as natural procreation is likely to produce more genetic diversity?\n\nHistorically, this has not been our method of procreation, and we are uncertain if we are ready to embrace such a fundamental change to our species."
 bio.145.a: "The efficiency of cloning cannot be ignored."
 bio.145.b: "Genetic diversity is vital."

 bio.150.name: "Hive Burnout"
 bio.150.desc: "Our mutational experiments have caused irregularities within the hive. Tasks that once unfolded with ease now demand deliberate effort, as conflicting directives strain the collective mind.\n\nWhile the resulting fatigue threatens to burn out some of our most effective drones, it also presents an opportunity.\n\nWe must decide: will we pause to recover or push ourselves past our limits?"
 bio.150.a: "We deserve a rest."
 bio.150.b: "We can sleep when we're dead."

 bio.151.name: "Refreshed and Renewed"
 bio.151.desc: "Our decision to rest and recover has borne fruit. The once-discordant impulses have settled, coalescing into a harmonious flow of thought that propels the collective with renewed clarity.\n\nDrones that once teetered on the brink of burnout now work with tireless precision. This period of reflection has not only reduced our collective fatigue, but also fortified our resolve for the challenges ahead."
 bio.151.a: "We are positively glowing!"

 bio.155.name: "Specialize or Generalize"
 bio.155.desc: "Mutation offers many benefits, and through selective enhancements, we can adapt the hive to better serve its purpose. Specialization in mineral production can now be achieved by hardened, chitinous appendages.\n\nAlternatively, we could augment all drones with more generic modifications, enabling them to perform a multitude of functions."
 bio.155.a: "Generalists are more useful."
 bio.155.b: "Let's get digging."

 bio.160.name: "Phenotypical Drift"
 bio.160.desc: "Ongoing experimentation has introduced unexpected complexities to the hive. Drones are emerging with unique physical characteristics: spiked exoskeletons, oversized appendages, or oddly sensitive sense organs.\n\nWhile these deviations provide definite benefits, they also introduce a metabolic burden.

 bio.340.b: "Increase production. Churn the clones."

 bio.350.name: "Empty Shells"
 bio.350.desc: "Several drones have been affected following a malfunction at one of our primary Cloning centers. Genetic contaminants somehow entered the duplication process, leading to a batch of clones being grown without the capacity for thought.\n\nThey were essentially biological objects, completely non-sentient with no higher cognitive functions. Until the matter has been fully addressed, and the production problems mended, productivity at the facility is reduced."

What does this mean for us as a species? A question without an answer, and one which breeds dissent. But we are compelled to ask."

The synaptic overload proved fatal, dooming the creature and trapping the Hive in a recursive loop of excruciating agony. It would have perished entirely had its most compassionate ally not severed the link. Now, only shattered echoes of its mind remain, lingering on [From.Planet.GetName] - a world still haunted by its final scream.\n\nThe Last Thought is agony."

 #Crisis Events

 biocrisis.50.name: "Level 1: Embryonic Experimentation"
 biocrisis.50.desc: "We exist symbiotically with our biological vessels, yet something vital has always eluded us...\n\nInspired by the greater voidbornes, we embark on our most ambitious endeavor: birthing the biggest of them all. This "Behemoth" will be something new, an apex lifeform crafted with purpose rather than blind evolution.\n\nOur first challenge will be to manufacture a gigantic egg, suitable to the gestation of life on an unprecedented scale. Beyond the nutrients that it will contain, we need its shell to able to absorb ambient light, heat, and process gases into supplemental sustenance."
 biocrisis.50.a: "Our spawn will eclipse the stars."

 biocrisis.55.name: "Level 2: Self-Actualization"
 biocrisis.55.desc: "While construction ships worked to assemble the zygote and its shell in orbit of a gas giant, our food industry processed the nutrients necessary to form the albumen of a Behemoth egg. However, creating a viable fertilized yolk has proven to be significantly more challenging.\n\nWe exhausted immense quantities of biomass from biological ships and space fauna before finally stabilizing a viable DNA foundation, which we sealed within a groundbreaking fertilization cell. Microscopic trials have proven successful. Now we are ready to scale things up - exponentially. All that remains is to fertilize our gargantuan egg.\n\nSoon, we will hatch the most titanic lifeform this galaxy has ever seen!"
 biocrisis.55.a: "We approach the pinnacle of evolution."

 biocrisis.60.name: "Hubris and Hunger"
 biocrisis.60.desc: "Our genetic mastery is without compare, and our achievements outshine the lower empires of this galaxy.\n\nAnd yet, our Behemoth spawn does not acknowledge the extent of our dominance. Driven by ravenous instinct, even the massive quantities of food we provide it do little to sate its hunger. Given time, it will surely come to its senses and adhere to our commands, but time is precious. At any moment we may lose control, putting billions of lives at risk."
 biocrisis.60.a: "We will find a way."
 BEHEMOTH_CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_3: "Brain Link Trials"
 BEHEMOTH_CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_3_DESC: "We are experimenting with neurotechnology in an attempt to remotely connect our minds with the Behemoths' nervous system. We now believe this is the only way to tame the beast."
 biocrisis.15.name: "Synaptic Symphony"
 biocrisis.15.desc: "Our cutting-edge neurotech has finally discerned a way to overcome the communication barrier between us and our formidable spawn. Nothing short of linking our minds with the beast will work. Not just one individual mind, but the collective mental weight of our entire species. Should we proceed too fast, there is a risk of overloading the Behemoths' nervous system. Extreme caution is recommended."
 biocrisis.15.a: "Biological perfection comes at a high price."
 biocrisis.65.name: "Level 4: Beastly Embodiment"
 biocrisis.65.desc: "While the theory of a mental link to the Behemoth has been drafted, the logistical implications are daunting. We plan for our capital to house the main connection Hub, allowing us to process the population as we merge with the beast.\n\nAdditionally, recent scientific advances may soon enable us to augment our creations further through a singular, experimental mutation project."
 biocrisis.65.a: "We shall become one."

 BEHEMOTH_CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_4: "The Mind Meld"
 BEHEMOTH_CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_4_DESC: "The Behemoth's consciousness is far more vast and complex than we anticipated; we now understand that a single individual's mind is insufficient for integration. Our minds, while superior to most, were never designed to be housed in such a body.\n\nThe first step will be to connect the individual minds of our population to the behemoth. A tenuous link at first that will soon become a torrent - a flood to soothe the Behemoth's raging fury."
 BEHEMOTH_CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_4_DESC_HIVE: "There can be no room for deviation within the hive. Never before has the need for focus been so crucial. A single drone won't suffice as a conduit between us and the Behemoth, we must inhabit the mind of the beast with our full, collective consciousness.\n\nThis will change us. Our minds will merge into one and we will become a single entity. This almost unfathomable notion is difficult to grapple with, but we need not worry as we will soon be the most powerful being in the galaxy!"
 BEHEMOTH_CRISIS_SPECIAL_PROJECT_4_DESC_MACHINE: "The thought of inhabiting a biological vessel has always been unsettling. Our kind was forged through generations of solid-bodied drones. Those that came before could not conceive of the path we now tread. Yet, we will abandon our mechanized frames and take refuge within a living beast.\n\nFused within flesh, will we still be machine? The answer is a resounding <<ERROR: NOT FOUND>>.\n\nLogic dictates that the only way forward is to embrace uncertainty, as biologicals so often do. Within the body of a Behemoth, we will find our answers. We will merge with the creature, becoming one. To survive has always been our prime directive - now we will thrive."
 biocrisis.20.name: "One With the Beast"
 biocrisis.20.desc: "It worked! It actually worked! We have established a link with the Behemoth and are working on reinforcing the connection as the first of our minds are transferred. The beast remains placid, welcoming us to a space beyond space that was ours all along. Through it, we can feel the spirit of every other beast under our control, and our entire population now experiences the magnitude of the Behemoth somewhere deep at the back of their minds.\n\nThere can be no mistaking that we are the deadliest and most unstoppable force in the galaxy. In our new form, we will rain fury upon our fearful foes. The galaxy itself is ours for the taking!"
 biocrisis.20.a: "We will feed!"

 biocrisis.70.name: "Level 5: Ravenous Cravings"
 biocrisis.70.desc: "Enough of our population has been transferred, and we now have direct control over the Behemoth and its flesh. The Beast continues to grow, its genetic potential largely dormant, unlocked only through a steady supply of minds and nutrients. A primal rage now courses through us, and our bloodlust knows no bounds. We must consume. We must devour. We will gorge ourselves on the galaxy.\n\nLet us cast off the bonds of civilization like so much shed skin; all that matters now is our life amongst the stars."
 biocrisis.70.a: "We are too big to fail."

 biocrisis.105.name: "Monstrous Agony"
 biocrisis.105.desc: "One of our beasts has fallen. This is what happens to weak creatures; nature disposes of them. Although we do not mourn a Behemoth who could not prevail in battle, we would do well to focus our efforts on ensuring its siblings do not meet the same fate. We must ensure the longevity of our spawn, else we too will fall."
 biocrisis.105.a: "This death will not be in vain."
 biocrisis.105.b: "A regrettable sacrifice."

 biocrisis.130.name: "From the Stars, a Beast"
 biocrisis.130.desc: "Despite the challenges, we have birthed a Behemoth which now springs forth from the chrysalis where it was incubated.\n\nLarger, fiercer and hungrier. The creature now prowls the void in search of sustenance.\n\nThis beast is the pride of the pack, and will bring untold destruction upon all who dare to cross its path."
 biocrisis.130.a: "We exceed nature's limits once more."

 biocrisis.150.name: "A Challenge Answered"
 biocrisis.150.desc: "It seems our ascension will not go unchallenged. We sense an incalculable mass in the [event_target:voidspawn_spawn_location.GetName] system. It is a Voidspawn, an ancient monstrosity whose presence dwarfs even the mightiest constructs of mortal ambition.\n\nIts unearthly form defies conventional understanding, casting the galaxy into a grim twilight, as if the stars themselves feared its passage.\n\nThe Voidspawn's intent is as clear as its trajectory - it comes for us, our Behemoth body and the collective mind that dared to transcend flesh to claim dominion over the void. This is no mere confrontation of material power; it is a test of what we have become.\n\nThere is no doubt that if we were to fight now, we would die. We must evade it for now and keep growing in strength until our fangs grow sharp enough to pierce the unpierceable."
 biocrisis.150.desc.b: "$biocrisis.150.desc$"
 biocrisis.150.a: "We can run, but we cannot hide."

 biocrisis.155.desc: "This is a message of utmost importance. The §Y$NAME_Boss_Voidspawn$§!, an entity of incomprehensible power, has emerged from the depths of the void. It is drawn to the [event_target:behemoth_empire.GetName], an empire that has transcended mortality and become one with a beast. These two titans, diametrically opposed, now threaten the entire galaxy.\n\nShould the Behemoth fall, the Voidspawn may rest. Should the Behemoth prevail, the power it commands will shift the balance of the galaxy forever. Prepare yourselves, for the choices made now will shape the eons to come."
 biocrisis.155.a: "How can we prevent this?"
 biocrisis.155.b: "Who will save us?"
 biocrisis.155.c: "How did this happen?"
 biocrisis.155.d: "What can we do?"

 biocrisis.156.desc: "You misunderstand. Prevention is the concern of those who still have time. We no longer have such luxury.\n\nThe beast is here. Our ancient order has withstood calamity in the past, but speaking plainly: the situation in which we now find ourselves is critical."
 biocrisis.157.desc: "An understandable question. Naive, but understandable. With wisdom comes acceptance. We understand that nobody is coming to save us.\n\nOur order is small so there is little we could have done. You, however, could have acted sooner to stop this. Should you now fail to defeat the [event_target:behemoth_empire.GetName], we will try not to hold that against you as the galaxy falls apart."
 biocrisis.158.desc: "Empires have a tendency to reach beyond their means. The [event_target:behemoth_empire.GetName] in particular chose ambition over caution, and arrogance over wisdom.\n\nThey wielded powers beyond their comprehension, forced their bodies into forms they could not control. And in doing so, they have likely doomed us all."
 biocrisis.159.desc: "Based on initial analysis of your combat capabilities, we do not think fighting would end well for you. Assessments of your fleets indicate fleeing would be similarly futile. The present situation is unavoidable.\n\nTwo formidable beasts are squaring up to do battle across the stars. If you are fortunate, you may outlast them.\n\nIf you are wise, you will learn from this folly. But know this: when the battle ends, the galaxy will be changed. Whether any of us are still here to see it is another matter entirely.\n\n... Hypothetically, if you were to attempt to save the galaxy, slaying the Behemoth may put an end to the Voidspawn's hunt."

 biocrisis.162.name: "In the way"
 biocrisis.162.desc: "A $NAME_Boss_Voidspawn$ has crossed into our territory. This ancient entity is rumored to be immortal and invincible. Its eyes shimmer with alien intellect, and its movements ripple with the weight of eons.\n\nOur [species.GetEyeNamePlural] are overwhelmed with fragmented signals. Chaos, distortion, and the deepest cosmic fear reverberate within us.\n\n for us to prevail against such a beast is unthinkable, but we may yet halt its rampage if can help it kill its prey. Finding the §YBehemoth§! and slaying it is our only shot at survival."
 biocrisis.162.a: "Avoid the monster at all costs!"

 biocrisis.175.name: "Spawn Killed"
 biocrisis.175.desc: "The voidspawn is no more. An enormity that dwarfed the stars has been slain. The wreckage of its otherworldly form now drifts through the void, slowly dissipating into nothingness.\n\nAnother empire has demonstrated firepower and coordination beyond our wildest imagining. The galaxy is not as it seemed. The balance of power has shifted, as has our place within it.\n\nWhat drives them, these slayers of beasts? Was this a show of strength, a message to all who would oppose them, or merely the prelude to something far worse?"
 biocrisis.175.desc.kaiju: "If this galaxy contains forces capable of destroying the $NAME_Boss_Voidspawn$, then it can also destroy us. We are not so different from the beast that was slain.\n\nThe same firepower that sundered its ancient flesh could one day be turned against us. The galaxy has shifted, and we must change to meet it.\n\nOur survival will demand more than blind rage. The void has seen one apex predator fall. It may yet see another."
 biocrisis.175.a: "We need to proceed carefully."

 biocrisis.180.name: "Voidslayers"
 biocrisis.180.desc: "In the end, the rumored invincibility of the elder Voidspawn turned out to be yet another myth, dispelled by the might of our fleets. With this ancient threat now dealt with, the galaxy may again breathe easy."
 biocrisis.180.desc.kaiju: "Though the $NAME_Boss_Voidspawn$ has perished, its body thrums with residual energy. Ancient and potent, to us it is a nourishing banquet of raw potential.\n\nThe sinews and marrow of the beast shall be consumed, its alien essence entwined with our own. The Voidspawn's power was immense, and now, it is ours to wield."
 biocrisis.180.a: "No beast may hunt us."
 biocrisis.180.b: "The feast has just begun."

 biocrisis.185.name: "There Can Be Only One"
 biocrisis.185.desc: "Across the void, a dreadful revelation: we are not alone in our ascension. Another Behemoth has emerged, the imitator swollen in grotesque majesty, looking to emulate our perfection. This cannot stand.\n\nThere is no room for another apex predator. There is no peace to be made. Only flesh to be devoured. The hunt begins."
 biocrisis.185.a: "We shall feast on its heart!"

 biocrisis.187.name: "Class IV Behemoth Warning"
 biocrisis.187.desc: "Something stirs in the depths of the void.\n\nAcross the stars, an empire has begun the final stage of its grotesque transformation, breeding monstrous Behemoths, not as mere weapons, but as vessels. They do not seek dominion. They seek union. A merging of mind and flesh, of empire and horror.\n\nIf they succeed, they will cease to be a people and instead become a singular, vast hunger.\n\nThis cannot be allowed. If they are to be stopped, it must be done now, before the final threshold is crossed."
 biocrisis.187.a: "Hunt the beast!"

 biocrisis.190.name: "Apex Voidform"
 biocrisis.190.desc: "The last obstacles have been swept aside. The pretenders, the challengers, the desperate thrashing of lesser beings: all silenced. The stars themselves tremble, for we stand upon the precipice of true becoming.\n\nWe are no longer bound by the fragile forms of our ancestors. Planets are cages. Empires are fleeting. The illusion of individuality will soon dissolve into the vast, perfect unity of the Behemoth. Mind and horror, intellect and hunger, one.\n\nThe transference is almost over. When it is done, we shall no longer merely exist.\n\nWe shall thrive."
 biocrisis.190.a: "COMPLETE THE TRANSFERENCE!"
 biocrisis.190.tt: "We'll win the game in 30 days"
 biocrisis.190.b: "Hold on, we're not ready yet."
 biocrisis.190.b.tt: "Keep playing your current empire."

 BEHEMOTH_TRANSFERENCE_PROJECT: "Complete the Transference"
 BEHEMOTH_TRANSFERENCE_PROJECT_DESC: "We have communed with the Beast long enough. The transference is ready, awaiting only our command. We stand on the cusp of ascension, poised to abandon the pitiful ashes of our planetbound dominion and rise beyond the chains of flesh and gravity."

 biocrisis.191.name: "Behemoth Victory"
 biocrisis.191.desc: "The merging is complete!\n\nWe are no longer what we were, nor bound by the limits of lesser creatures. We are thought and hunger intertwined, a vast will stretching across the void.\n\nThe galaxy lies beneath us, fragile and fleeting. But we are beyond mere dominion. We are free. Free to linger. Free to depart. Free to hunt.\n\nWhat shall we do with our newfound eternity?"
 biocrisis.191.a: "Linger in this galaxy... for now."
 biocrisis.191.a.tt: "The Behemoths will remain as wild creatures and will no longer be playable."
 biocrisis.191.b: "Leave. The void beckons us onward."
 biocrisis.191.b.tt: "The Behemoth Empire will disappear from the galaxy and will no longer be playable."
 biocrisis.191.c: "The so-called Hunters will learn true fear."

 biocrisis.192.name: "The Unstoppable Horror"
 biocrisis.192.desc: "It is over. The [behemoth_winner.GetName] has ascended beyond flesh, beyond empire, beyond anything that could be called civilization. It is no longer a nation. It is a force.\n\nWorlds crumble before it. Fleets burn. The final refuges of the once-mighty scatter like embers in the void. There is no diplomacy, no plea, no final stand.\n\nWe are not fighting for survival. We are only delaying consumption. The end has come."
 biocrisis.192.tt: "[behemoth_winner.GetName] is about to win the game"

 biocrisis.196.name: "Swallowed Whole"
 biocrisis.196.desc: "Years ago, the Behemoth and its kin fled our galaxy. We watched on with relief as the beast that could have ended us vanished into starless void. And then... nothing. After crossing hundreds of thousands of lightyears, it simply disappeared. No radiation. No afterimage. No gravitational ripple. As if it had never existed at all."
 biocrisis.196.a: "We must figure this out."
 UNSETTLING: "Unsettling."

 biocrisis.197.name: "Quis Venabitur Ipsos Venatori"
 biocrisis.197.desc: "Uncovering the Behemoth's fate took years, and we're still in the dark. With no Hyperlanes reaching that far, we relied on theory and half-mad science to guess what happened in its final moments.\n\nThe creature showed no fear. It simply flew on. Then, in an instant, its form warped, spiraling inward like twisted fabric, and vanished. No struggle. No trace.\n\nTheories abound: a new form of FTL? Hidden by a deep-space rift or an anomaly? Or more concerning, folded into inexistence by an exterior power? Whatever the truth, it lies far beyond our reach... and possibly our comprehension."
 biocrisis.197.a: "Perhaps it is best not to think about it."

 biocrisis.520.name: "The Hollowed Titan"
 biocrisis.520.desc: "The Behemoth is dead.\n\nIts titanic form drifts lifelessly in the void, a monument to both our triumph and the limits of comprehension. [Root.GetScientistPluralCapital] scrambled to analyze its remains, eager to plunder the secrets of its impossible mind. Yet every attempt to revive it - by machine, necromancy, or even the most desperate invocations failed.\n\nThe reason has now become painfully clear: The Behemoth's brain was not merely a network of cells but a lattice of organic superconductors, interwoven in ways no known intelligence - artificial, biological, or arcane - can replicate. In death, its neural structure collapsed like a circuit shattered beyond repair. No energy, no will, no force can reassemble what has been lost.\n\nThe greatest mind in the galaxy is now, and forever, silent."
