 OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "So the other members of the Community are the vassals of the Custodian then? No? Apologies, but we are still struggling to understand the exact nature of this arrangement."
 OUTSIDER_TO_CUSTODIAN_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The Galactic Community has always been a rotten institution, and that was BEFORE the idiots in its Senate made you Custodian."
