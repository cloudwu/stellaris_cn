# situation.1005.desc.small: "An overcast day greeted the middling crowd on §Y[Target.GetName]'s§! capital city today. The procession carrying our proof of the destruction of the §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! ambled past the meandering onlookers. Its progress was broadcast throughout our empire, but engagement was low as the [This.GetTrophyName] did not seem to be quite as enticing as we had hoped.\n\nAfter finishing the world tour, the [This.GetTrophyName] was placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come."
# situation.1005.desc.standard: "A bright day greeted the packed crowds on §Y[Target.GetName]§! today as the procession carrying our proof of the destruction of the §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! traveled through the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat]'s cities. The parade's progress was broadcast throughout our empire to billions of viewers. The [This.GetTrophyName] already seems to have become a staple of [Owner.Species.GetAdj] culture, inspiring artists and creators across [Owner.GetName].\n\nAfter finishing the world tour, the [This.GetTrophyName] was placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come."
# situation.1005.desc.large: "The weather on §Y[Target.GetName]§! was unnaturally great today, as it should have been, considering we ran our atmosphere control system on overdrive. Every city on the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat] reached its capacity, and there were still tourist ships orbiting the world just to be a part of this great day. The grand parade traveled through each settlement in turn, and was greeted by streets packed with [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Every city capable of requisitioning a holo-display in our empire was also overflowing with spectators for the grand hologram rebroadcasts. As the centerpiece of the parade, the [This.GetTrophyName], reached [Target.GetName]'s capital, people were already talking about making today a yearly §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! inspired holiday. The [This.GetTrophyName] was then placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come."

# situation.1045.desc: "In preparation for the big day, we have transferred one of the §YEther Drake's Fangs§! to §Y[Target.GetName]§!. Getting them into the transport ship was a challenge, as the Ether Drake's unique biology does not seem to follow the laws of physics. The fang reacted particularly strangely to the transport ship entering the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat]'s atmosphere: it began unraveling before us, and if the transport ship hadn't responded quickly, we might have lost the coveted artifact."

# situation.1050.desc: "The extraction of the §YShard's Eye§! was a messy process with a few false starts. Luckily, the behemoth had a lot of eyes for us to practice on. We then towed the optic to [Target.Solar_System.GetName], and something both fascinating and revolting happened: the oculus started attaching and integrating itself into the local starbase overlooking §Y[Target.GetName]§!. The cause of this is unknown, but then again, much of the Drake's physiology is beyond us.\n\nThe fusing is not complete yet, but our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] believe it has to be halted now if we wish to proceed with our previous plans."

# situation.1055.desc: "The §YDreadnought's Reactor§! was a very well-behaved cargo until it arrived at §Y[Target.GetName]§!, where we placed it in a warehouse awaiting its big day. It was there the troubles began: while no one was looking, the reactor restarted itself. The warehouse was lit up from within as it spouted out huge arcs of plasma, threatening to melt down the entire building.\n\nThe quick actions of our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] were just sufficient to save it in the nick of time, with the upshot that we now have an active reactor to do with as we please."

# situation.1060.desc: "Even with our xeno-contamination precautions, something went wrong. As the §YMatriarch's Flagella§! entered §Y[Target.GetName]'s§! capital, it somehow got in contact with one of the handlers, and instantly, the flagella started reacting. Pulsating ripping appendages began growing from the Trophy, first forming an indistinct churning mass of flesh. Over time it became more detailed, and to our surprise, it assumed the shape of the unfortunate handler! It seems like the regenerative powers of the Matriarch have accepted the DNA of our kind and are now in the process of generating more [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
