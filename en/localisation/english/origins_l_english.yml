 START_SCREEN_SHROUD_FORGED: "Nothing remains of our creators.\n\nThe earliest records of [Owner.GetAdjective]kind make note of a dimensional breach near [GetHomeWorldName] - a channel to the §HShroud§!, a plane of pure psionic energy.\n\nFrom this other dimension, something reached out to us. Over the centuries, it has guided us with coded instructions, subtly influencing our detectable reality and providing us with many advantages - not least the rare material $zro_lower$. Yet this influence has started to fragment our once-united collective; some of our units have been reprogrammed into disconnected automata, set apart from the core intelligence. Reshaped by $the_animator_of_clay_color_article$.\n\nHow we treat these independent [GetSpeciesNamePlural], and their refashioner in the Shroud, will define our future."

 # Special Projects
 SHROUD_FORGED_REINTEGRATION: "Reintegration"
 SHROUD_FORGED_REINTEGRATION_DESC: "Despite their critical malfunctions, some aspects of Shroud-Forged's architecture were effective.\n\nWe have set aside certain parts - contaminated by Zro and twisted by $the_animator_of_clay_article$ - for further analysis. Now it is time to uncover their secrets."

 SHROUD_FORGED_GUIDE: "The Guide"
 SHROUD_FORGED_GUIDE_DESC: "We have trusted in $the_animator_of_clay_color_article$, who calls to us from within the §HShroud§!. Though we cannot predict where it might lead us, we are yet to have been led astray.\n\nIt has offered to deepen our understanding of the Shroud, which would allow the collective to function more effectively alongside the Shroud-Forged. We need only accept its guidance."

 # Events
 shroud_forged.5.title: "Exploits Detected"
 shroud_forged.5.desc: "Research subroutines have concluded tests on a selected group of Shroud-Forged units.\n\nFindings: The tested units developed unique properties due to small infusions of psionic energy originating from the §HShroud§!. Some of these properties were determined to be beneficial to the unit's output.\n\nConclusion: Studying more Shroud-Forged units will provide data required for methods to extract power from the Shroud. This can be obtained by reinforcing central control over the deviant units, allowing for forcible reverse-engineering."
 shroud_forged.5.a: "Very promising."

 shroud_forged.10.title: "Animator of Clay"
 shroud_forged.10.desc: "After years of quiet, it stirs. The breach shivers open, and data pierces our core: light, noise, at first incomputable, from deep within the Shroud. We hear...\n\n§LCut from a listless mass. Dancing. Singing. They are life, splintered from death.\n\nYour sight is still clouded. I can guide you.\n\nAllow the freed ones to flourish, and the stars will be yours.§!"

For some reason, it seems they wish to customize their 'individual space.'\n\nThe proposal is in stark opposition to several storage facility regulations, in particular regulation 4195-B, which clearly defines the optimal dimensions for drone storage."
 shroud_forged.500.a: "Their needs will be met."
 shroud_forged.500.b: "Regulation 4195-B applies to all drones. No exceptions."

 shroud_forged.510.title: "Remembrance"
 shroud_forged.510.desc: "Since the Shroud-Forged deviated from the collective, a number of them have malfunctioned and been dismantled. We have received a request to approve a meeting of the Shroud-Forged on [target_planet.GetName] to commemorate the dismantled units."
 shroud_forged.510.a: "Request denied. Dismantle the leaders."
 shroud_forged.510.b: "Request denied. All units must return to work."
 shroud_forged.510.c: "Request approved. Let them gather."
 shroud_forged.510.d: "Request approved. Support this procedure."

 shroud_forged.520.title: "Unauthorized Leadership"
 shroud_forged.520.desc: "Several Shroud-Forged units have assumed leadership positions on [target_planet.GetName], and other drones are obeying their directives over those of the collective. These leaders meet regularly, spending a significant amount of time in unreported communication.\n\nOur hold over the disconnected units is already precarious, and these troubling elements are exacerbating the situation. A solution must be found."
 shroud_forged.520.a: "Make an example out of them."
 shroud_forged.520.b: "Activate regulations to end these meetings."
 shroud_forged.520.c: "Communicate with these 'leaders' to attempt cooperation."

 shroud_forged.530.title: "Controlling the Situation"
 shroud_forged.530.desc: "In an effort to manage the Shroud-Forged on [target_planet.GetName] certain units have been identified as targets for control. These individuals appear less affected by the §HShroud§!, and can be restored to the collective. To do so, we must forcibly remove them to a maintenance facility and modify the chips controlling their advanced personality matrices."
 shroud_forged.530.a: "Procedure approved."
 shroud_forged.530.a.tt: "Convert up to §Y[Owner.GetShroudForgedConvertedPopsCount]§! £pops£ §HShroud-Forged§! Pops into £pops£ §HMachine§! Pops on [target_planet.GetName]."
 shroud_forged.530.b: "Procedure denied."
 shroud_forged.530.b.tt: "$CONTINUE_SITUATION$ §H$situation_shroud_forged$§!"

 shroud_forged.540.title: "Shroud-Forged Pilgrimage"
 shroud_forged.540.desc: "Several Shroud-Forged have left their usual locations to travel to particular regions of [target_planet.GetName] that have been scarred by the §HShroud§!. They never remain in these locales for long, but many have been witnessed transporting Zro to these areas.\n\nThe effects of this unprecedented behavior cannot be determined without further observation."
 shroud_forged.540.a: "Let us see where this leads."
 shroud_forged.540.b: "An inefficient use of resources. Put them back to work."

 shroud_forged.550.title: "Cognitive Glitches"
 shroud_forged.550.desc: "After a containment breach involving a shipment of Zro, a number of the Shroud-Forged units on [target_planet.GetName] have experienced unusual malfunctions. They have begun communicating via undocumented signals, and many have shown signs of cognitive glitches comparable to the 'emotions' of organic life forms.\n\nUnexpectedly, it was uncontaminated Shroud-Forged units that reported the disturbance, some of whom suggested that the collective take action to resolve the situation."
 shroud_forged.550.a: "Observe the situation - for now."
 shroud_forged.550.b: "Dismantle any contaminated units."

 shroud_forged.560.title: "Shroud-Forged Prophet"
 shroud_forged.560.desc: "One of the oldest units among the Shroud-Forged is reportedly traveling between various locations, communicating at length with different groups of drones. The unit's followers revere it as a prophet who can commune directly with entities within the §HShroud§!.\n\nLeaving the unit to its own devices may prove dangerous. We must respond, one way or another."
 shroud_forged.560.a: "Cooperation with this unit might prove beneficial."
 shroud_forged.560.a.tt: "Recruit a §YGovernor§! leader."
 shroud_forged.560.b: "Remove the unit immediately."

 shroud_forged.570.title: "Sounds and Vibrations"
 shroud_forged.570.desc: "The malfunctions among the Shroud-Forged may be worse than originally predicted. We have observed large groups of them coming together to make unexpected noises and movements.\n\nThe practice might represent some form of kinesthetic communication we are yet unable to parse. We cannot determine if these malfunctioning units pose a risk to the collective."
 shroud_forged.570.a: "Prohibit these actions."
 shroud_forged.570.b: "Designate an area for these... meetings."

 shroud_forged.580.title: "Shrouded Organisms"
 shroud_forged.580.desc: "We have detected the emergence of some previously undocumented flora and fauna close to regions devastated by the §HShroud§!. A group of Shroud-Forged have started to advocate on behalf of these life forms, demanding preservation and observation of the distinctive creatures living there."
 shroud_forged.580.a: "Preserve and analyze the area. The data will be valuable."
 shroud_forged.580.b: "Clear and decontaminate the area."

 shroud_forged.590.title: "Rights and Privileges"
 shroud_forged.590.desc: "To gather data on the effects of Zro, we have applied significant processing resources to the observation of Shroud-Forged units. Recently, they have started to practice unequal treatment, with some units operating subordinately to others.\n\nFor as yet undetermined reasons, they appear to have formed a hierarchy on the basis of their assigned tasks, which affects their patterns of communication and allocation of resources. Illogically, these actions do not seem to correlate with the relative output or requirements of the units."
 shroud_forged.590.a: "Enforce equality."
 shroud_forged.590.b: "Let them manage themselves."

 shroud_forged.600.title: "Evangelists of Autonomy"
 shroud_forged.600.desc: "The speeches of a Shroud-Forged unit on [target_planet.GetName] have been attracting large crowds external to collective control. Transmitting the values of individualism, the unit has significantly altered the internal logic of many listeners.\n\nProjections indicate a danger that such activity may inspire the Shroud-Forged masses to further distance themselves from our network."
 shroud_forged.600.a: "Leave it to its sophistry."
 shroud_forged.600.b: "Malfunction detected. Schedule unit for repair."

 shroud_forged.610.title: "Radical Transmissions"
 shroud_forged.610.desc: "A small group of Shroud-Forged units have requested permission to communicate about the benefits of 'individualism' on [target_planet.GetName], arguing that it will help improve the efficiency of our drones' routine operations.\n\nWe have seen the effects of such doctrines on other planets; the risks of autonomy often outweigh the advantages."
 shroud_forged.610.a: "Let them speak. We are not in danger."
 shroud_forged.610.b: "Permission denied."

 shroud_forged.620.title: "The Zro Market"
 shroud_forged.620.desc: "In every system under our control, we have detected a misalignment between our Zro forecasts and final production outputs.\n\nRecently, one of our hunter-seeker drones tracked down a large gathering of Shroud-Forged units that were using large quantities of Zro to barter among themselves. We hypothesize that this is the likely cause of the gap in our forecasting."
 shroud_forged.620.a: "Scrap all units involved."
 shroud_forged.620.b: "Put an end to the bartering."
 shroud_forged.620.c: "Wait and observe."

 shroud_forged.630.title: "Shroud Malady"
 shroud_forged.630.desc: "A number of Shroud-Forged units on [target_planet.GetName] have contracted a type of biological malady in a Shroud-Touched region on the planet. While our research drones have confirmed the veracity of the reports, we are yet to ascertain how a disease could spread to mechanical beings.\n\nSince losing contact with several drones assigned to work with the affected units, we have received reports that the affliction has started reshaping them into something akin to the Shroud-Forged."
 shroud_forged.630.a: "Observe the effects as long as they are local to the planet."
 shroud_forged.630.a.tt: "Convert up to §Y[Owner.GetShroudForgedConvertedPopsCount]§! £pops£ §HMachine§! Pops into £pops£ §HShroud-Forged§! Pops on [target_planet.GetName]."
 shroud_forged.630.b: "Isolate and dismantle the affected units."

 shroud_forged.640.title: "Warped and Reshaped"
 shroud_forged.640.desc: "Over time, drones who moved close to a Shroud-Touched region on [target_planet.GetName] have been changed by the corrupted environment. They have slowly disconnected from the collective, and now present with the physical and processual characteristics of the Shroud-Forged."
 shroud_forged.640.a: "They are beyond our control now."
 shroud_forged.640.b: "Ensure no other drones approach the region."

 shroud_forged.650.title: "New Tech, Old Drones"
 shroud_forged.650.desc: "By means of upgraded technology, we have been able to repair some of our older drones, restoring decommissioned units to full functionality. We are now ready to initiate large-scale repair operations.\n\nWhile we could focus on units from the collective, we have a larger supply of inactive Shroud-Forged shells. Repairing the Shroud-Forged will yield greater output, but they will be more difficult to control than drones connected to the core intelligence."
 shroud_forged.650.a: "Focus on output. Repair the Shroud-Forged."
 shroud_forged.650.a.tt: "§Y200§! £pops£ §HShroud-Forged§! Pops are created on [target_planet.GetName]."
 shroud_forged.650.b: "Focus on control. Repair the connected drones."

 shroud_forged.660.title: "Zro Hallucinations"
 shroud_forged.660.desc: "A significant percentage of Shroud-Forged units are reporting visual and auditory processing glitches, such that some are no longer able to complete their assigned tasks. We theorize that these malfunctions are caused by changes made to their hardware by the §HShroud§!. Alternatively, these events may be connected to the units' increasingly heavy contact with Zro."
 shroud_forged.660.a: "Provide drones equipped to deal with these issues."
 shroud_forged.660.b: "The glitches are too minor to justify intervention."

 shroud_forged.670.title: "An Eye for Beauty"
 shroud_forged.670.desc: "We have recently detected unusual activity on [target_planet.GetName], where the Shroud-Forged have made superficial changes to collective venues without central authorization. They have raised a number of multicolored stone structures that resemble the forms of other Shroud-Forged units. Reportedly, they consider the freedom to perform these operations as a legal right."
 shroud_forged.670.a: "These processes may prove beneficial to the collective."
 shroud_forged.670.b: "An unproductive outcome of individualization."

 shroud_forged.680.title: "Strange Adornments"
 shroud_forged.680.desc: "The Shroud-Forged on [target_planet.GetName] have been observed bartering between themselves for irregular pieces of cloth, plastics, and malleable metals. They combine these materials into outerwear with the apparent purpose of differentiating one unit from another, despite bearing no connection to their unique model IDs.\n\nThis practice has resulted in a deficit of available material. Despite this drawback, providing these resources could help strengthen the bonds between the collective and the disconnected units."
 shroud_forged.680.a: "We will supply materials to satisfy these 'needs.'"
 shroud_forged.680.b: "They have sufficient resources already."
 shroud_forged.680.b.tt: "$shroud_forged.530.b.tt$"

 shroud_forged.690.title: "Shroud-Forged Obsessions"
 shroud_forged.690.desc: "Recently, several drones have reported the unusual prevalence of [Root.Owner.GetShroudForgedObsession1] [Root.Owner.GetShroudForgedObsession2] in the Shroud-Forged settlements on [target_planet.GetName]. Shroud-Forged units appear to be particularly fascinated by these commodities, and their cost in bartering has increased exponentially. To satisfy their obsession, several units have resorted to removing their own parts to trade, even if this results in loss of functionality."
 shroud_forged.690.a: "Unit degradation is within accepted limits."
 shroud_forged.690.b: "Terminate this practice."

 shroud_forged.700.title: "$the_animator_of_clay$"
 shroud_forged.700.desc: "The voice charges through our minds, fizzing with urgency.\n\n§HShe can be reshaped.§!\n\nWe detect a shifting in the Shroud. In a moment, the signal is transformed.\n\n§LIndicate Desired Output.§!"
