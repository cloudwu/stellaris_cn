 distar.1000.desc:0 "The hulk orbiting [From.GetName] is all that remains of the Vechtar Zavonia, a massive sub-light generation ship belonging to a deeply religious alien race called the Mardak Vol.\n\nThough the ship has been ruthlessly purged of all life, the Mardaks' ill-fated journey has been detailed in the captain's logs. After being hunted to near extinction by nightmarish beings referred to as 'Vessels', they fled their homeworld in search of a distant paradise planet - the mythical promised land Paridayda, that would reveal itself only to the chosen ones. Judging by the state of their ship, however, their attackers caught up with them.\n\nShall we extract the ship's navigational drive and decrypt its destination?"

The ship's captain and crew have not taken the disappointment lightly."

Closer studies revealed that what looked like the planet surface was in fact an energy shield, upon which a barren world's texture was projected, and hidden below it, a lush Gaia planet reminiscent of the Mardaks' prophecies.\n\nBut that isn't all! As the crew deactivated the shield they discovered a peaceful stone age civilization consisting of a symbiotic union between mammals and fungi who live in crude huts, oblivious to the outside world. The nightmarish 'Vessels' live on only as mythical beings in their legends."

 ### Trojan Asteroid ###
 distar.3000.name:0 "Machinery Inside"
 distar.3000.desc:0 "As suspected, the asteroid [From.GetName] holds within it a great mass of metal and does indeed hide some manner of machinery.\n\nThe gathered data clearly shows that its constituent parts contain great quantities of stored energy, but its purpose remains unknown."
 distar.3000.a:0 "Proceed carefully."
 distar.3000.a.tooltip:0 "Gently excavate the asteroid."
 distar.3000.b:0 "Probe it."
 distar.3000.b.tooltip:0 "Dispatch a drill probe to retrieve a sample."
 distar.3001.desc:0 "Caution proved well in order. Hidden inside [trojan_asteroid.GetName] was a host of old mining drones programmed to attack on sight.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] fortunately detected this early and was able to jam the drones' sensors long enough to disable them.\n\nThe drones' cores are old indeed, but retain vast amounts of energy for siphoning."
 distar.3002.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName]'s forceful probing proved unfortunate. Within the asteroid was hidden a host of old mining drones, programmed to attack on sight.\n\nThe drones have picked up on the [Root.GetName]'s presence and are beginning to stir.\n\nThere may still be time for an evasive maneuver, if [Root.GetName] acts quickly."
 distar.3003.desc:0 "News of the events relating to asteroid [trojan_asteroid.GetName] have reached the networks of [Root.Capital.GetName]. The scientific community has reacted with curiosity, posing questions as to why the drones were originally placed inside the asteroid.\n\nWere they guarding something?"
 distar.3005.desc:0 "As the science community on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] hypothesized, the drones found in asteroid [trojan_asteroid.GetName] were indeed hiding something.\n\nThe valiant efforts of the [Root.GetName]'s crew have unearthed rich mineral deposits in the asteroid's core, previously obscured by the drones' presence."

 ### Impossible Organism ###
 distar.3010.desc:1 "The surprising life readings from [impossible_organism_planet.GetName] have been attributed to a small organism of exceeding tenacity. The [Root.GetName]'s crew is unsure how to classify the lifeform, but its ability to survive, seemingly without any sustenance, is truly astonishing. Considering the planet's age, it is not impossible that the organism has been fighting its habitat's toxicity for millennia, though this is an educated guess at best.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has requested permission to retrieve samples of the unknown organism, so that it may be studied."
 distar.3010.a:0 "Very well, sample it."
 distar.3010.b:0 "No. Study it from afar."
 distar.3010.b.tooltip:0 "Adds the §YImpossible Organism§! modifier to [From.GetName]:\n£society  §G+3§!"

It is already visible to the naked eye and responds to stimuli, and appears able to absorb energy and nutrition from nearly anything, organic or not.\n\nAlas, its genetic, cellular, and biochemical processes remain beyond our understanding."
 distar.3011.a:1 "We should continue to study it."
 distar.3011.a.phobe:0 "Disgusting! Poke it with a stick..."
 distar.3011.b:0 "This alien is too dangerous."
 distar.3011.b.tooltip:0 "Shoot the lifeform into deep space."

 distar.3012.name:0 "Impossible Fungoid"
 distar.3012.desc:0 "After recent breakthroughs, the strange lifeform is no longer a complete mystery! The scientific community on [Root.Capital.GetName] are abuzz with the news.\n\nThe organism has been classified as a fungoid - partly explaining its ability to absorb molecules for nutrition. It has grown immensely, now the size of a newborn [Root.GetSpeciesName], and appears both inquisitive and intelligent. Thankfully, it has thus far shown no signs of aggression.\n\nThe scientists believe the next step to be attempts at communication, though it may be months before any progress is made on this front."
 distar.3012.a:1 "Proceed with the communication attempts."

 distar.3013.name:0 "Impossible Fungoid: First Words"
 distar.3013.desc:0 "The small fungoid has recently begun to vocalize!\n\nIts first words were a guttural "nivlac." Incoherent, but ardently repeated. And so the scientists have proudly named the fungoid §Y$NAME_Nivlac$§!. Since then its language has developed at a spectacular rate and it's now able to successfully convey the seven primary emotions - and does so often to its own spawn. It reproduces - by spreading its spores - as a matter of routine, and the laboratory will soon be insufficient to house the fungoids.\n\nThe $NAME_Nivlac$ still has not shown any signs of aggression."

 distar.3015.desc:0 "The alien lifeform once discovered on the toxic planet [impossible_organism_planet.GetName], and later fired into deep space after being deemed too dangerous, appears to have made planetfall on [nivlac_planet.GetName] some time thereafter.\n\nIt not only survived the impact, but has since managed to make a home of its new planet. It has prospered, grown, and subdivided into a small population, to the point of becoming a spacefaring species in and of itself.\n\nThey call themselves $NAME_Nivlac$, and unfortunately appear to recall our earlier disregard for their survival."

 distar.3016.name:0 "The $NAME_Nivlac$"
 distar.3016.desc:1 "Our scientists are pleased to report that the $NAME_Nivlac$'s relocation to a suitable planet was a great success.\n\nSince the young fungoid's arrival at [nivlac_planet.GetName], it is apparent that its explosive growth has continued. It has established itself as a small people, and recently even developed FTL technology - undoubtedly aided by the technology we left behind.\n\nWe shall eagerly continue to watch their development."

 distar.3017.desc.assim:0 "The assimilation of the fungoid $NAME_Nivlac$ into [Root.Owner.GetAdj] society is underway.\n\nWhile the $NAME_Nivlac$ are resistant toward the process, their consciousnesses will eventually be sublimated into the [Root.GetAdj] whole."

 ### Stranded Scientist ###
 distar.3020.name:0 "Stranded Scientist"
 distar.3020.desc:2 "The wreckage on the asteroid [From.GetName] is the remains of a vessel belonging to a now-stranded scientist - [stranded_scientist_leader.GetName] - identifying herself as belonging to the hitherto-unknown [stranded_scientist_species.GetName] species.\n\nFrom amidst the wreckage she somehow managed to contact [Root.GetLeaderName], the Science Officer stationed aboard the [Root.GetName], and is requesting to be rescued. She explains that her collision was due to malfunctioning navigational sensors, and that she has been unable to leave the asteroid for several years.\n\nShe claims her scientific knowledge to be without equal, and that she would be a valuable asset. She points to her survival as proof of that."
 distar.3020.a:0 "She may join our cause."
 distar.3020.a.tooltip:0 "[stranded_scientist_leader.GetName] joins the [Root.Owner.GetName] and will share her technological knowledge."

 distar.3021.a.tooltip:0 "Our research into £physics£ §YTechnologies§! is furthered."

 ### Molluscoid Miners ###
 distar.3030.name:0 "Molluscoid Miners"
 distar.3030.desc:0 "A closer look at [molluscoid_miners_planet.GetName] has shown that its hut-like structures are home to a molluscoid species. The huts are crude shelters, built out of soil and quasi-fecal excretions.\n\nThe molluscoids appear semi-sapient with limited intelligence. Besides survival, their society and lives revolve around unearthing minerals which are then put on display, seemingly to raise the social standing of the finder.\n\nTheir means of locating these minerals remain unclear, however, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is baffled by their ability to locate large deposits of minerals.\n\nThough technologically inferior, studying these molluscoids may well further our mining capabilities."
 distar.3030.a:0 "Intriguing. Study them further."
 distar.3030.b:0 "Mine their minerals."

 distar.3031.desc:0 "The molluscoids inhabiting [molluscoid_miners_planet.GetName] employ a strange method to locate their coveted minerals.\n\nApparently their skin naturally produces gelatinous secretions which seep into the porous soil, trickling ever downward while remaining attached to their skin as long strings. These secretions effectively sample the soil, feeding back sensory information to the molluscoid individual as long as the slimy strands remain unbroken. In this manner, they are able to map out surprisingly large parts of the underground terrain and map out mineral veins.\n\nIf we were to integrate the molluscoids into our society, or simply advance our production processes with this knowledge, it is likely our mining enterprises would benefit greatly."
 distar.3031.a:0 "Granted. Begin the integration."
 distar.3031.b:0 "Yes, we will use this knowledge."
 distar.3031.c:0 "No. Mine their planet."

 distar.3032.name:0 "Molluscoid Integration"
 distar.3032.desc:0 "The integration of the molluscoids into [Root.Owner.GetAdj] society is complete.\n\nTo facilitate the integration, they have been given the name §Y[molluscoid_miners_species.GetName]§!. The [molluscoid_miners_species.GetName] are obedient and hardworking, and a marked increase in our mineral production has already been observed."
 distar.3032.a.tooltip:0 "[molluscoid_miners_species.GetName] £pops£ Pops have been added to empty tiles on [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 distar.3032.b:0 "They're here... Somewhere."
 distar.3032.b.tooltip:0 "Due to the high population density of [Root.Capital.GetName], the [molluscoid_miners_species.GetName] species is statistically insignificant and unfortunately largely irrelevant to civic life."

 distar.3033.name:0 "Mineral Mapping"
 distar.3033.desc:0 "A system enabling us to quickly chart underground terrain and the minerals it contains has been implemented.\n\nBy analyzing planetary reflection of particular solar and cosmic rays, which are unable to penetrate most minerals, we can gather data on the crust's mineral composition. This makes it possible to essentially x-ray a target body, be it an asteroid or part of a planet.\n\nOur scientists have dubbed it Mineral Mapping, and it should greatly improve our mineral production."

 ### Alien Machine ###
 distar.3040.name:0 "Alien Machine"
 distar.3040.desc:0 "Further scans suggest the machine is still operational, though its purpose remains entirely unclear.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has never seen anything like it. Some of its materials look familiar, but most are strange and utterly alien as the design of its components.\n\nThe machine has what appears to be a console, with one item in particular standing out: a large crooked lever of unknown material."
 distar.3040.a:0 "Pull the lever."
 distar.3040.a.tooltip:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] pulls the strange lever."
 distar.3040.b:0 "Take it apart."
 distar.3040.b.tooltip:0 "The machine is disassembled and its parts salvaged."

 distar.3041.name:0 "Alien Machine"
 distar.3041.desc:0 "It is unclear what happened when the machine's lever was pulled.\n\nIts console flickered, powerful vibrations could be felt, and then a wave of energy surged from the machine, expanding outwards into deep space. The scientists close by felt this wave push past them, but experienced no other sensory evidence of its passing.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is unsure what to make of it. The machine itself returned to its inactive state immediately thereafter, and no longer returns any energy readings."
 distar.3041.a:0 "How strange. Now take it apart."
 distar.3041.b:0 "Intriguing. Research the machine."
 distar.3041.b.tooltip:1 "Adds the §YAlien Machine§! modifier to [asteroid_target.GetName]:\n£physics£ §G+7§!"

 distar.3042.name:0 "Energy Spike"
 distar.3042.desc:2 "As our scientists pulled the lever the machine emitted a huge blast of energy that multiplied in shockwaves, twisting and rippling through the void, tearing open a wormhole in §Y[system_one.GetName]§!.\n\nAfter the residuous energy diffused the wormhole and the immediate area around it settled and now appear to be stable enough for safe passage. As for what awaits us on the other side our scientists are not so sure.\n\nThe machine itself has since returned to its inactive state and no longer gives off any anomalous readings."

 ### Orbital Speed Demon ###
 distar.3050.name:0 "Orbital Speed Demon"
 distar.3050.desc:0 "Attempts to scan the object in high-speed orbit of [From.GetName] have been unsuccessful. The object quickly falls below [From.GetName]'s horizon and the [Root.GetName]'s instruments are simply unable to keep up.\n\nWhile [From.GetName]'s gravitational pull is strong, that alone does little to explain the object's extreme momentum. Either the object itself possesses some extraordinary properties, or there is some gravitational phenomenon at work here.\n\nThe object's velocity appears to be increasing over time, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] suspects that it may soon be thrown out of orbit, even without outside interference."
 distar.3050.a:0 "Try to slow it down."
 distar.3050.a.tooltip:0 "Dispatch a drone and attempt to latch onto the object to reduce its momentum."

 distar.3051.name:0 "Speed Demon Halted"
 distar.3051.desc:0 "The drone successfully intercepted the unknown object's orbit.\n\nBy latching onto the object and then thrusting in reverse little by little, the drone was eventually able to direct it to the [Root.GetName] for retrieval.\n\nThe object looks to be some sort of box, constructed of alien material. Vein-like ridges meander along its sides, congregating at the top in some type of sphere-shaped mechanism. We can only guess at its contents."
 distar.3051.desc.1:0 "The ejected debris successfully collided with the unknown object, reducing its velocity before knocking it out of orbit. The [Root.GetName] was able to retrieve it soon thereafter.\n\nThe object looks to be some sort of box, constructed of alien material.

 distar.3052.name:0 "Speed Demon Lost"
 #distar.3052.desc: "The drone successfully latched onto the unknown object, but the added mass of the drone and the change in trajectory soon caused both drone and object to be pulled out of orbit, tumbling into deep space at high speed."

 distar.3055.name:0 "Alien Box Opened"
 distar.3055.desc:0 "At long last, our scientists have penetrated the outer material of the alien box.\n\nThe box holds three small liquid-filled vials - one §Rred§!, one §Bblue§!, and one §Ggreen§!. The liquids are less alien than their container and our scientists have identified them as primed gene-modification mediums.\n\nFor reasons beyond our understanding, the solutions are quickly deteriorating outside their alien container, but there should be enough time to synthesize and apply one of them to our species. It has been confirmed that its effects would be positive, but exactly how remains to be seen."
 distar.3055.desc.1:0 "At long last, our scientists have penetrated the outer material of the alien box.\n\nThe three small vials inside are indeed filled with different liquids - one §Rred§!, one §Bblue§!, and one §Ggreen§!. The liquids are less alien than their container and our scientists have identified them as primed gene-modification mediums.\n\nFor reasons beyond our understanding, the solutions are quickly deteriorating outside their alien container, but there should be enough time to synthesize and apply one of them to our species.

 distar.3056.desc:0 "Finally, our scientists have managed a peek into the alien box without compromising the container itself. By utilizing an advanced type of sonar, they have been able to identify its contents.\n\nThe contents are puzzling or, at least, unexpected. The box holds three small vials, each filled with an unknown liquid.\n\nThe box is safe to open, but it will require further research to understand how."

 distar.3060.desc:0 "The anomaly found close by [breathing_rift_object.GetName], however unlikely, appears to be some type of rift in space. It's possible the great mass of [breathing_rift_object.GetName] somehow caused it, but its nature is beyond our understanding.\n\nThe rift not only refracts and blocks light, but seems to actually draw it in and then push it out, repeatedly - as if it were breathing photons.\n\nIt is likely the immense gravitational pull of the rift has at some point inhaled in other things, as well. We should exercise caution."

The nanites may have been deposited on the planet by some unknown spacefarers for an unknown purpose.\n\nAs far as [Root.GetLeaderName] can tell, the nanites compiled themselves into perfectly oriented crystalline lattices and replicated until a point at which they became deactivated. While the crystals they created do in fact resemble buildings, they are entirely uniform in composition, and cannot possibly have served any such purpose."

Not only are the plentiful sand dunes on the planet composed of rare metal granulate: the sand itself is almost entirely composed of countless broken nanites!\n\nThese microscopic machines are millions of years old, their structure degraded far beyond any chance for reactivation. While we cannot determine a source of origin for these nanomachines, the society that created them must have been highly technologically advanced.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetName] postulates that the nanites may have been used to terraform the surface [From.GetName], millions of years ago."

At some point the complex was abandoned, and its automated gas replicators ran unchecked for untold centuries, gradually converting the planet into a gas giant."

Analyzing it in conjunction with other insights into the ancient Gateway Builders, however, may yield valuable data on how these L-Gates could be reactivated."
