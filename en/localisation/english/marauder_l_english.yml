 marauder.1.name:0 "[encountered_marauder.GetName] Encountered"
 marauder.1.desc:0 "We have made first contact with the §H[encountered_marauder.GetName]§!, a nomadic civilization. They occupy a number of large space stations in and around the §H[marauder_system.GetName]§! system that house the bulk of their massive numbers in crowded and squalid conditions. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, they seem to have developed a strong martial culture. Life in the cold void has become second nature to them, and they are very adept at space warfare.\n\nThere is no [encountered_marauder.GetSpeciesName] central government to speak of. Instead, they are divided into several different factions that vie endlessly with one another for resources and respect. Given their large population and the shipbuilding capability of their stations, this constant infighting is the only thing keeping them from growing into a significant threat to galactic peace."
 marauder.1.a:0 "Attempt to contact them."
 marauder.3.name:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName] Warriors Sighted"
 marauder.3.desc:0 "For several months now, we have received scattered reports of small numbers of alien mercenaries and privateers operating on the frontiers of our space. They call themselves the §H[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!, and are apparently exiles from a nomadic warrior culture inhabiting overcrowded space stations in and around the §H[marauder_system.GetName]§! system.\n\nTheir passage near our space proceeded without incident, but they warned us against trespassing in [marauder_system.GetName]. There is no [From.GetSpeciesName] central government to speak of, but their various factions are engaged in constant infighting and often launch raids against neighboring star systems. Indeed, given their vast population and space-based production capability, the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] would likely be a significant galactic power if they ever stopped killing each other."
 marauder.5.name:0 "The End of the [From.GetName]"
 marauder.5.desc:0 "The once proud nomadic warrior culture of the §H[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! is no more. Forces from the §H[marauder_killer.GetName]§! have destroyed the last of the massive space stations that housed the majority of their population. Refugees from their surviving civilian population have scattered across the galaxy.\n\nAlthough some [From.GetSpeciesName] pirate and mercenary fleets may still be unaccounted for, the loss of their space dwellings is a devastating blow that they cannot recover from. This puts a definite end to their raiding."
 marauder.5.a:0 "Indeed."
 marauder.6.name:0 "Vengeance of the [marauder_species.GetNamePlural]"
 marauder.6.desc:0 "A large fleet of §H[marauder_species.GetName]§! mercenaries has translated out of hyperspace in the §H[attacked_system.GetName]§! system! It looks like all of the surviving [marauder_species.GetName] mercenary outfits that were deployed elsewhere when we smashed their last space station have put their differences aside and joined forces.\n\nWe are not certain how they manage to elude our sensor cover to reach [attacked_system.GetName], but they are transmitting a message on an open channel."
 marauder.7.1.desc:0 "To the wretched cowards of the [Root.GetName]:\n\nAs you destroyed our homes, we shall now burn yours. We have nothing left to lose - you have made certain of that. All that we hope for now is to die in battle, and to take as many of your so-called warriors with us as possible when we journey into the Great Beyond.\n\nReady your defenses!"
 marauder.7.2.desc:0 "Dwamaks of the [Root.GetName]! You bash our homes, now we bash yours! We know we may not survive, but we take as many dwamaks with us as possible!\n\nDeath to all dwamaks! HYEEEEEIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!"
 marauder.7.3.desc:0 "To the apostates of the [Root.GetName]:\n\nYou have defiled our most sacred of spaces and murdered countless of Her subjects. Did you think that She of the Void would let these atrocities pass unanswered?\n\nShe demands sacrifice, and we shall deliver. It will be our last act in this wretched world."
 marauder.7.a:0 "Battle stations!"
 marauder.8.desc:0 "A large fleet of §H[marauder_species.GetName]§! mercenaries has crossed into the §H[From.GetName]§!. It looks like all of the [marauder_species.GetName] mercenary outfits who were deployed elsewhere when the [From.GetName] smashed their last space station have put their differences aside and combined forces.\n\nThey are intent on exacting vengeance for the destruction of their homes, and intercepted communications makes it clear that their warriors have no intention of surviving the campaign."
 marauder.10.name:0 "[marauder_species.GetName] Refugees Arrive"
 marauder.10.desc:0 "A battered flotilla of tramp freighters carrying §H[marauder_species.GetName]§! refugees fleeing the recent destruction in their home systems have arrived in our space. They have been allowed to settle on §H[Root.GetName]§!.\n\nAlthough these refugees are used to living on crowded space stations under squalid conditions, they seem to be adjusting well to their new planetary home. Hopefully they are ready to leave their past as raiders and pirates behind them."
