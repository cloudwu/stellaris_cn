 ancrel.7001.name:0 "Revealing the Site"
 ancrel.7001.desc:0 "The freezing climate of [From.Planet.GetName] has covered the site in thick layers of ice and snow. The desolate location of this site may be a hint of the need for discretion. Whatever took place here, someone wanted to keep it hidden."
 ancrel.7002.name:0 "Clearing the Tunnels"
 ancrel.7002.desc:0 "The complex consists of several larger underground structures connected with a network of tunnels, many of which are collapsed or blocked by ice. Although ancient, some of the tunnels show clear signs of fire. The damage caused by the fire is major enough to suggest a catastrophic event, or perhaps intentional destruction. One thing is sure, and that is that the purpose of this site seems to be scientific in nature."
 ancrel.7004.name:0 "Ancient Biological Lab"
 ancrel.7004.desc:0 "Further investigation reveals that the primary purpose of this site seems to have been in the research and development of biological agents. The whole complex seems to have been purged by fire, possibly as the result of the accidental release of one of the biological agents being developed here. With careful and meticulous study of the artifacts that remain, some clues may be found."

 ancrel.7006.2.desc:1 "The Soulstone, pulsing with inner light, seems to wordlessly beckon. We touch it, and our minds are drawn in to a pocket dimension of the Shroud, where the enigmatic entity called $relic_zro_entity_name$ awaits.\n\nIt knows things no mortal being could know, and seems willing to share its secrets now that we have reached its sanctum."

 tech_secrets_league_desc:0 "The sprawling empire of the First League dwarfed our own at its peak, and relied on implacable bureaucracy to keep the wheels of the state in motion. The quantic filing arrays they used afforded them unprecedented efficiency in the sorting and storing of documents."
 tech_secrets_irassian:0 "Irassian Naval Yards"
 tech_secrets_irassian_desc:0 "The Irassian astronaval tradition was unmatched in their time. Their shipyards produced a constant stream of ships for their navy and merchant fleets, which would ultimately be their downfall.

 tech_archaeo_mass_accelerator_desc:0 "This cannon fires a barrage of ancient miniscule ionized spheres that charge upon contact with most force fields, giving them high levels of shield penetration.
