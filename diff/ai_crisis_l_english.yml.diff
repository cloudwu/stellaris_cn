NEW crisis.2092.desc:2 "The starbase orbiting §H[Root.GetStarName]§! has been scuttled! We are still trying to piece together exactly what happened, but it appears that several members of its command staff, including the chief engineer, had been replaced by Synthetic infiltrators.\n\nBetween them the Synths must have managed to obtain the starbase's self-destruct codes. Most of the station's crew escaped to the surface of [Root.GetName] before it was destroyed, but our losses in materiel and property were substantial."
