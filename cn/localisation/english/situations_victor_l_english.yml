 #Events
 situation.1005.name: "[This.GetLeviathanParadeName]"
# situation.1005.desc.small: "An overcast day greeted the middling crowd on §Y[Target.GetName]'s§! capital city today. The procession carrying our proof of the destruction of the §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! ambled past the meandering onlookers. Its progress was broadcast throughout our empire, but engagement was low as the [This.GetTrophyName] did not seem to be quite as enticing as we had hoped.\n\nAfter finishing the world tour, the [This.GetTrophyName] was placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come."
# situation.1005.desc.standard: "A bright day greeted the packed crowds on §Y[Target.GetName]§! today as the procession carrying our proof of the destruction of the §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! traveled through the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat]'s cities. The parade's progress was broadcast throughout our empire to billions of viewers. The [This.GetTrophyName] already seems to have become a staple of [Owner.Species.GetAdj] culture, inspiring artists and creators across [Owner.GetName].\n\nAfter finishing the world tour, the [This.GetTrophyName] was placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come."
# situation.1005.desc.large: "The weather on §Y[Target.GetName]§! was unnaturally great today, as it should have been, considering we ran our atmosphere control system on overdrive. Every city on the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat] reached its capacity, and there were still tourist ships orbiting the world just to be a part of this great day. The grand parade traveled through each settlement in turn, and was greeted by streets packed with [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Every city capable of requisitioning a holo-display in our empire was also overflowing with spectators for the grand hologram rebroadcasts. As the centerpiece of the parade, the [This.GetTrophyName], reached [Target.GetName]'s capital, people were already talking about making today a yearly §Y[This.GetLeviathanTargetName]§! inspired holiday. The [This.GetTrophyName] was then placed in a specialized display at the center of the capital to inspire generations to come."
 situation.1005.a: "If they won't to show up for it, why did they ask for a celebration?"
 situation.1005.b: "Today was a good day for all [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 situation.1005.c: "We stand united today, as one."

 situation.1045.name: "Destabilized Fang"
# situation.1045.desc: "In preparation for the big day, we have transferred one of the §YEther Drake's Fangs§! to §Y[Target.GetName]§!. Getting them into the transport ship was a challenge, as the Ether Drake's unique biology does not seem to follow the laws of physics. The fang reacted particularly strangely to the transport ship entering the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat]'s atmosphere: it began unraveling before us, and if the transport ship hadn't responded quickly, we might have lost the coveted artifact."
 situation.1045.a: "Construct a better container and bring the fang down."
 situation.1045.b: "This reaction is much more interesting than any parade."
 situation.1045.b.tooltip: "Cancel the parade in favor of studying the reaction."
 situation.1045.c: "Replace the fang with a replica."
 situation.1045.c.tooltip: "This will reduce the amount of unity the opportunity will produce."
 situation.1050.name: "Overseer"
# situation.1050.desc: "The extraction of the §YShard's Eye§! was a messy process with a few false starts. Luckily, the behemoth had a lot of eyes for us to practice on. We then towed the optic to [Target.Solar_System.GetName], and something both fascinating and revolting happened: the oculus started attaching and integrating itself into the local starbase overlooking §Y[Target.GetName]§!. The cause of this is unknown, but then again, much of the Drake's physiology is beyond us.\n\nThe fusing is not complete yet, but our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] believe it has to be halted now if we wish to proceed with our previous plans."
 situation.1050.a: "Let us see with the sight of The Shard!"
 situation.1050.a.tooltip: "Cancel the parade in favor of using the eye for a different purpose."
 situation.1050.b: "Scrape it off, we have deadlines to reach."
 situation.1050.c: "Very carefully remove it, we wouldn't want to damage it."
 situation.1055.name: "Power Surge"
# situation.1055.desc: "The §YDreadnought's Reactor§! was a very well-behaved cargo until it arrived at §Y[Target.GetName]§!, where we placed it in a warehouse awaiting its big day. It was there the troubles began: while no one was looking, the reactor restarted itself. The warehouse was lit up from within as it spouted out huge arcs of plasma, threatening to melt down the entire building.\n\nThe quick actions of our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] were just sufficient to save it in the nick of time, with the upshot that we now have an active reactor to do with as we please."
 situation.1055.a: "Attach it to the [Target.GetPlanetHabitat]'s power grid."
 situation.1055.b: "Incorporate it into the performance."
 situation.1055.b.tooltip: "This will increase the amount of unity the opportunity will produce."
 situation.1055.c: "Find the off-switch"
 situation.1060.name: "Regenerating Flagella"
# situation.1060.desc: "Even with our xeno-contamination precautions, something went wrong. As the §YMatriarch's Flagella§! entered §Y[Target.GetName]'s§! capital, it somehow got in contact with one of the handlers, and instantly, the flagella started reacting. Pulsating ripping appendages began growing from the Trophy, first forming an indistinct churning mass of flesh. Over time it became more detailed, and to our surprise, it assumed the shape of the unfortunate handler! It seems like the regenerative powers of the Matriarch have accepted the DNA of our kind and are now in the process of generating more [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 situation.1060.a: "Use this to feed the onlookers!"
 situation.1060.b: "Let the reaction run its course."
 situation.1060.c: "Cauterize the Flagella."
 situation.1065.name: "Perpetual Pursuit of the Plume"
# situation.1065.desc: "While carrying home the §YSky Dragon's Plume§!, our transportation ship noticed that the hyperlane they traveled through had a second distortion beyond their ship. Initially disregarding this as just an anomaly, it was not apparent until the ship entered §Y[Target.Solar_System.GetName]§! that a group of pursuing entities was causing the hyperlane-dilation: a clutch of dragon whelps exited into our system in hot pursuit of our transport ship. They must have lain in hiding near the jump point and followed our exit. The dragonlings do not seem to possess the mental faculties of their progenitor and seem to be aimlessly following us or, more particularly, the plume."
 situation.1065.a: "Kill the pests."
 situation.1065.b: "We should set up a sanctuary for them in [Target.Solar_System.GetName]."
 situation.1065.b.tooltip: "Cancel the parade in favor of giving an asteroid for the whelplings to inhabit."
 situation.1065.c: "Imagine having live subjects for the parade!"
 situation.1065.d: "Fire some warning shots, drive them off!"
 situation.1070.name: "The Densest of Metals"
# situation.1070.desc: "This morning, a surprise awaited us on §Y[Target.GetName]§! as the §YScavenger Bot's Compactor§! deposited the last of its creations in our storage facility. The large chunk of alloys was denser and more compact than anything we could ever hope to produce, containing enough metals in a few cubic meters to build an entire battleship. This fantastic development has our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] believing that they can get the compactor working again at §G0.001%§! efficiency, if we should wish it."
 situation.1070.a: "Break it apart and use it for construction."
 situation.1070.b: "Incorporate into the parade."
 situation.1070.c: "Return the Compactor to space and let it work."
 situation.1070.c.tooltip: "Cancel the parade in favor of reactivating the compactor and gaining a $d_alloys_10$ deposit in orbit of [Target.GetName]."
 situation.1075.name: "The Leaking Sack"
# situation.1075.desc: "The strobing lights of the §YStellar Wraith's Disperser Sack§! were distracting to look upon, so distracting that it took a while to detect that the sack the Wraith used to generate its natural shield was leaking. After quickly confirming that exposure to the chemicals inside would not cause a total ecological collapse on §Y[Target.GetName]§!, our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] focused on analyzing the effects the gas had on our atmosphere.\n\nIt seems like the emitted chemicals have fused with our mesosphere and disperse concentrated energies surprisingly well. So well that if we release the rest of the disperser's contents, there would be a noticeable increase in planetary defensiveness."
 situation.1075.a: "Extract the rest of the gas and let the reaction finish."
 situation.1075.a.tooltip: "Cancel the parade in favor of infusing [Target.GetName]'s atmosphere with the $wraiths_energy_disperser$."
 situation.1075.b: "Plug it up."
 situation.1075.c: "Incorporate it into the performance."
