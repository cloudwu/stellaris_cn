 enclave.25.desc:1 "Our fleet has overcome the defenses of the mercenaries in [merc_system.GetName], and their station has been blown to pieces. The rest of the [FROM.GetName] collapsed quickly after, and their remaining fleets have disbanded. While some of the surviving captains may turn to piracy, others have announced their plans to honor smaller contracts, offering logistical support or space station garrisoning. But such trifling affairs are of little consequence. The important fact is that the Mercenary Enclave is no more, and from its wreckage we have been able to salvage a sizable amount of resources."
 enclave.26.desc:1 "Word has reached us that a Mercenary Enclave has been destroyed by the [mercenary_destroyer.GetName] in [merc_system.GetName]. The aggressors proved too strong for the [FROM.GetName] to face on their own, and the station housing the Board, barracks, and their shipyards was destroyed. The mercenary fleet disbanded shortly after, as every captain was left to fend for themselves, but some representatives have stated that they will honor the company's contracts in logistics and starbase garrisoning as best they can despite the dissolution of the Company."

 enclave.240.e:0 "The Contingency AI"
 enclave.245.desc:0 "The Khan's ships present an overall well rounded composition, with no clear weakness. Our analysts suggest that torpedoes might perform well to take their ships down, but caution against specialized defense. A mix of both shields and armor is probably your best bet to keep your ships alive. The Khan has proven to be an extremely competent commander and underestimating them would be a terrible mistake. Consider their retinue as an extreme menace."
 enclave.250.desc:0 "The Gray Tempest relies on two complementary weapon types: energy beams and strike craft. The former is countered by shields, but shields are bypassed by their strike craft. Our projections show that ships fitted with point defense in addition to shields have a much better chance to survive the engagement. Nanite ships are extremely well protected, but torpedoes might help in breaching their defenses."
 enclave.255.desc:0 "Prethoryn fleets rely on slow moving projectiles and hosts of smaller ships to take down their foes. One option to fend them off is to use point defense, coupled with armor and improvements to your ship's hull resilience; another is to engage them at extreme range. With sufficiently powerful energy weapons, one might manage to destroy their fleets before they can even get in range."
 enclave.260.desc:0 "The Unbidden's exclusive reliance on energy gives us an obvious weakness to exploit. Weapons dealing extra damage to their shields should prove devastating, but if you can fit weapons that completely bypass their shields, they won't be long for this dimension. Defensively, you should look at bringing your own shields to the fight to adequately counter their energy beams."
 enclave.265.desc:0 "Contingency ships exclusively use energy weapons- as such, it is best to use shields to mitigate incoming damage. Simulations indicate that despite having strong defense, their ship's hulls are relatively fragile. Our analysts estimate that penetrating weapons might perform very well against them."
