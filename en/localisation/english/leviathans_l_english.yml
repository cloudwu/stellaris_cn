Some researchers believe it to be a malfunctioning scrap collection service machine from a lost empire, its purpose long since muddled by hardware degradation. Others believe it to have originated as a single microscopic nanobot, programmed to endlessly build itself larger and stronger by exploiting its environment. Still others reckon it may have started out as a robotic ship's captain; the sole survivor of an intergalactic battle waged millennia ago. Perhaps its reasoning systems were irrevocably damaged by the sudden destruction of its entire civilization.\n\nOf course, this is all just speculation."
 leviathans.555.b:0 "Can we communicate with it?"
 leviathans.555.b.reply:2 "Over the years there have been many attempts to communicate with it, or else to alter the programming of the Scavenger. Unfortunately, most of those expeditions ended up part of the cosmic scrap yards where the Scavenger Bot dwells. Only those who were able to outrun it survived.\n\nThe Scavenger has welded enough heavy artillery onto its patchwork frame to single-handedly destroy an entire nation's fleet - an event that may already have occurred on more than one occasion. Of course, any such destructive encounters would only have served to further strengthen the Scavenger, providing it with more ship components to repurpose."

Our §Yvery§! educated guess is that its biology is the result of some outer-dimensional fusing of dark matter and solar matter. It dives into stars, feasting on their innards in order to fuel its own, internal fusion reactor. It brings death to all systems it reaches.

 leviathans.3001.desc:0 "We have encountered some kind of vast entity near [horror_system.GetName]. It appears to exist only partially inside our own universe, with the bulk of the creature still trapped in whatever nightmarish realm it spawned from.\n\nThere is a malevolent intelligence at work here, ancient beyond our concept of time and utterly alien in its design. We can only guess as to its purpose."
 leviathans.3001.a:0 "It can't be good."
 leviathans.3003:0 "Banished"
 leviathans.3003.desc:2 "The malignant entity which attempted to breach our universe near [guardians_horror_system.GetName] has been banished back into its own realm. Only time will tell if its influence has been sufficiently weakened to keep it there for good.\n\nWe are detecting some kind of anomalous residual energy that must have been left behind by the dimensional rifts the creature opened. Studying this energy more closely could potentially lead to scientific breakthroughs."
 leviathans.3003.a:0 "Let us see what will come of it."
 leviathans.3004a.desc:0 "$leviathans.3004.intro$\n\n$leviathans.3004.jumpdrive$"
 leviathans.3004b.desc:0 "$leviathans.3004.intro$"
 leviathans.3004.intro:2 "Our study of the energy anomalies produced by the [guardians_horror_system.GetName] dimensional rifts has finally yielded results. The energies involved in the creation of these portals are unlike any we have ever encountered."
 leviathans.3004.jumpdrive:0 "Most intriguing of all, our scientists theorize that it may be possible to devise a new method of interstellar travel using these exotic energies."

 ### AUTOMATED DREADNOUGHT
 leviathans.3100:0 "Automated Dreadnought"
 leviathans.3100.desc:0 "A single, massive warship has been discovered patrolling the [dreadnought_system.GetName] system. No life signs can be detected on the vessel, but it is emitting a very strong power signature and appears to be bristling with weapon systems. It does not respond to hails.\n\nCaution is advised."
 leviathans.3100.desc.mach:0 "A single, massive warship has been discovered patrolling the [dreadnought_system.GetName] system. No organic life signs can be detected on the vessel, but it is emitting a very strong power signature and appears to be bristling with weapon systems. It does not respond to hails or data transmission.\n\nCaution is advised."
 leviathans.3100.a:0 "Look at the size of that thing!"
 leviathans.3102:0 "Dreadnought Disabled"
 leviathans.3102.desc:0 "We have managed to disable the automated dreadnought in the [guardians_dreadnought_system.GetName] system. Despite the punishment it took from our ships, the structural integrity of the warship's massive hull remains largely intact.\n\nOur boarding parties found the mummified remains of the dreadnought's alien crew still manning their stations. Before expiring, they activated some kind of automated patrol mode which the limited shipboard AI has been locked in for the past 7.8 million years.\n\nAlthough it would take an incredible amount of resources, some of our engineers believe that the dreadnought can be restored and put back into service with our fleet. It would certainly make for a powerful flagship."
 leviathans.3102.a:0 "That ship will sail the stars again under our flag!"
 leviathans.3102.b:0 "It would be a waste of resources. Salvage it for parts."
 leviathans.3103:0 "Dreadnought Repaired"
 leviathans.3103.desc:0 "This is a momentous day! Our skilled repair crews and engineers have finished their work on the ancient dreadnought we disabled in the [guardians_dreadnought_system.GetName] system. The massive warship has received its full crew complement and been declared ready for service after conducting space trials."
 leviathans.3103.desc.mach:0 "This is a day of significance! Our skilled repair bots and engineering units have finished their work on the ancient dreadnought we disabled in the [guardians_dreadnought_system.GetName] system. The massive warship has received its full crew complement and been declared ready for service after conducting space trials."
 leviathans.3103.a:0 "A powerful addition to our fleet."

 ### HIVER
 leviathans.3201:0 "Swarming Hive Craft"
 leviathans.3201.base: "Fast-moving attack craft are hitting our mining stations in the [hiver_system.GetName] system! These unidentified aggressors swarmed out of several previously dormant asteroids in the belt that are now displaying huge power signatures."
 leviathans.3201.desc:1 "$leviathans.3201.base$\n\nWe can only surmise that these asteroids serve as some kind of hive for a previously unknown spaceborne life form. Whatever they are, our expanding mining operations seem to have provoked them into action!"
 leviathans.3201.desc.void_hive: "$leviathans.3201.base$\n\nThe hive inside of the asteroid has become agitaded by our recent mining. It seems this system isn't big enough for the both of us."
 leviathans.3201.a:0 "They are coming in fast!"
 leviathans.3202:0 "Crystalline Asteroids"
 leviathans.3202.base: "The [hiver_system.GetName] system is home to an unusually dense asteroid belt with unique properties. Several of the larger asteroids are covered in crystalline outcroppings that appear to be extremely rich mineral deposits."
 leviathans.3202.desc:1 "$leviathans.3202.base$\n\nHowever, long-range sensors are tracking sporadic movement from several small, unidentifiable objects - possibly spacecraft - in the denser regions of the belt. We are unable to get a fix on them, but we have identified debris from at least two destroyed mining stations, floating in space near some of the larger asteroids."
 leviathans.3202.desc.void_hive: "$leviathans.3202.base$\n\nWe have detected movement within the belt: a form of rudimentary hive mind, feasting on its mineral hoard. We could subsume their consciousness and under our guidance they would be a powerful deterrent."
 leviathans.3202.a:0 "Something isn't right..."
 leviathans.3202.b: "They are similar. Let them serve."
 leviathans.3202.c: "Let's see how they react to us."

 leviathans.3204:0 "Asteroid Hives Defeated"
 leviathans.3204.desc:0 "Our forces have managed to smash the alien hive asteroids in the [hive_system.GetName] system. They are once again dormant, and we are not detecting any more of those vicious attack craft.\n\nOne of the asteroids is still reasonably intact, despite the damage inflicted upon it. We should consider dispatching a science party to see what we can find inside it."
 leviathans.3204.a:0 "Prepare an away team."

 leviathans.3205.desc:0 "Our science team has finished exploring the massive network of tunnels and chambers running through the hive asteroid in the [hive_system.GetName] system. No live specimens of the spaceborne creatures that attacked us were encountered, but the scientists did find the remains of some kind of birthing chamber.\n\nThis has given us a great deal of insight into the life cycle of these entities, further expanding our understanding of galactic biology."
leviathans.3230.name: "Meteorites Mustered"
leviathans.3230.desc: "The inhabitants of the [from.solar_system.GetName] system have awoken. While still hostile to most spacecraft, we can rest easy knowing that [from.solar_system.GetName] will be a bastion under the protection of our new primitive drones."

 DRAGON_INCUBATION_PROJECT:0 "Drake Egg Incubation"
 DRAGON_INCUBATION_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The egg recovered from the Dragon's Hoard still shows faint signs of life. It should be possible to deduce and emulate an ideal incubation environment for the egg, with the goal of eventually hatching it. Should we be successful in hatching the egg, the resulting Ether Drake is unlikely to match its ancestors in size or power, but with proper domestication will undoubtedly prove to be an incredible asset.\n\nThe egg will not last long outside of the environment it was found in. We must act quickly."

Receiving information from a black hole is impossible, but the Infinity Machine appears to have a method of accessing its gravitational data and getting information out of it. It simply takes a §Yvery§! long time.\n\nWe only need to lend it our processing power, easing its computational burden by a tiny fraction."
 TECHNOSPHERE_HACKING:0 "Hacking the Calculator"
 TECHNOSPHERE_HACKING_DESC:0 "Hacking into the metallic sphere's central programming might yield some further insight into what it is and what it is doing."
 TECHNOSPHERE_DESTRUCTION:0 "Sphere Fracturing"
