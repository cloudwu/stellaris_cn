After unleashing their entire nuclear arsenal upon Paridayda, turning the Mardak Vol's formerly lush homeworld into ash, they doused the fiery wreckage in fungicide, dissolving the last remains of the Mardak Vol into a toxic slush. Dangerous or not, the parasitic fungoids are no more."

They may have been deposited on the planet by some unknown spacefarers for an unknown purpose.\n\nAs far as [Root.GetLeaderName] can tell, the nanites compiled themselves into perfectly oriented crystalline lattices and replicated until a point at which they became deactivated. While the crystals they created do in fact resemble buildings, they are entirely uniform in composition, and cannot possibly have served any such purpose."
