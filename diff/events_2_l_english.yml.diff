NEW story.105.desc.phile:1 "The Space Amoebas - the nickname now lovingly popularized on [Root.Capital.GetName] - are solitary animals, when left to their own devices. All but the youngest specimens are accompanied by quasi-independent organisms, dubbed flagella, seemingly spawned by the Amoeba and programmed through liquid, RNA-laced secretions to do the bidding of the host. Initially assumed to be young Space Amoebas, the flagella do not seem to factor into any reproductive mechanics, each individual flagellum instead operating solely as a disconnected limb for its host Amoeba. These flagella are capable of manipulating and even attacking objects in an impressive yet restricted range around the host, periodically returning to lodge inside the host Amoeba's body for re-programming.\n\nThere are potential military applications to be found in the regenerative properties of the amoeba's thick hide, or in the flagella's graceful patterns of movement."

NEW story.205.desc.spiri:0 "The Crystalline Entities - the name itself a compromise between rival factions of xeno-biologists and xeno-geologists on [Root.Capital.GetName] - exist beyond such base concepts as life, and death.

Each individual Crystal Sovereign is rarely accompanied by more than two subservient entities, a Sentinel and a smaller Crystal Cohort. The Entities do not mate, nor do any of them appear older or younger than others - they are all sprung from some immaculate, past eon.
