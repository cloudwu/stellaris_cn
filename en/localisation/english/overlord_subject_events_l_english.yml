 ## Event Chain - Lucrative Adventures for Veterans
 subject.1.title:0 "Lucrative Adventures"
 subject.1.desc:0 "A large contingent of our veterans has sent a letter requesting leave to travel to the colony at [subject_empire.Capital.GetName], the capital of our vassal [subject_empire.GetName]. Included with the letter is a gift of credits to "grease the wheels of bureaucracy", as they so delicately put it.\n\nIt seems there are quite a lot of stories among some of our soldiers about the lucrative adventures one can find in those systems - be it as a mercenary or a pirate. In either case, it is made clear that they have put together what credits they have, hoping to make many times that if they are sent off to [subject_empire.Capital.GetName].\n\nIf we were to formally send them to [subject_empire.Capital.GetName] they are at least more likely to be a boon to the leadership there - and more likely to respect the laws and rules of our vassal - than if we were to let them run free."
 subject.1.a:0 "Give them formal leave to travel to [subject_empire.Capital.GetName]."
 subject.1.a.tt:0 "The veterans will be sent to aid [subject_empire.GetName]."
 subject.1.b:0 "Let them do as they wish."
 subject.1.b.tt:0 "The veterans might cause havoc in [subject_empire.GetName]."
 subject.1.c:0 "We will not be bribed by these would-be privateers."
 subject.1.c.tt:0 "The veterans will not be allowed to leave our empire."

 subject.3.title:0 "Veterans from [overlord_empire.Capital.GetName]"
 subject.3.desc:0 "We have received a group of veterans from our overlord, [overlord_empire.GetName]. It seems they have formally been sent here by [overlord.Ruler.GetRegnalName] to aid us, and to share their experience and knowledge with our troops - or so they claim.\n\nFrom the get-go, it is made clear that these soldiers envisioned a different environment to the one they have found. Mumbling and grumbling among their contingent has made its way back to us. It seems they believed they would find riches, or else become pirates to steal from us.\n\nIf we are going to let these veterans stay, we should make sure to keep them on a short leash."
 subject.3.a:0 "Put their experience to good use."
 subject.3.b:0 "Send them back to [overlord_empire.GetName]."

 subject.10.title:0 "Good Relations"
 subject.10.desc:0 "Though we had our reservations about sending the adventure-seeking veterans to [subject_empire.Capital.GetName], we have received reports from our vassal that they have found themselves at home there, and have proven to be more helpful than one would originally expect."
 subject.10.a:0 "It seems our worries were misplaced."

 subject.12.title:0 "Veterans Returning"
 subject.12.desc:0 "After a short stay at [subject_empire.Capital.GetName], our veterans have been sent home to [Root.Capital.GetName]. Apparently they only proved to be trouble, and caused some havoc among our subject population."
 subject.12.a:0 "So it turned out as expected, after all."

 subject.14.title:0 "Privateering Adventures"
 subject.14.desc:0 "Our initial worries seem to have been well-placed. Shortly after getting to [subject_empire.GetName] our old soldiers seem to have embraced piracy. If nothing else, this betrayal does not seem to have been traced back to us yet."
 subject.14.a:0 "Let us hope it stays that way."

 subject.16.title:0 "Defying Orders - Mercenaries"
 subject.16.desc:0 "It seems that the veterans who asked us for leave to go to [subject_empire.Capital.GetName] have not only defied our orders, but they have also claimed it was done in our name. At this point it would be an embarrassment if we were to go in and tell everyone that we do not have our own people under control."
 subject.16.a:0 "Let us hope they make a good impression then."

 subject.18.title:0 "Defying Orders - Pirates"
 subject.18.desc:0 "It seems that the veterans have defied our orders, and set off towards [subject_empire.Capital.GetName] after all. Our latest reports say they have left all signs of being affiliated with us behind, and started taking up a life of piracy."
 subject.18.a:0 "Much as expected, then."

 subject.62.desc_overlord_gestalt:0 "The engineering drones arrived at [targeted_starbase.GetName] shortly after we sent our messenger to [overlord_empire.GetName]. Supposedly they were quick to organize everything the way they wanted, and the process of refitting the starbase was swiftly done.\n\nAlthough some of the details of the restructuring of the starbase still evade us, our engineers hope to understand more, given time."
 subject.62.a:0 "We are grateful nonetheless."

Our subject is now looking to us for aid, as they seem unable to defend themselves.\n\nConsidering the militaristic nature of our diplomatic agreement, it would be only natural for us to step in and protect them from further harm. Some of our advisors wonder if we all might be better served by inspiring our vassal to rise up and defend themselves, rather than by intervening directly."

 subject.105.desc:0 "As the mistreatment of our people continues, many are looking to our overlord, [overlord_empire.GetName], for potential aid. They have long demanded much of us, and it seems only fair that they would step in now that our people are suffering under foreign occupation.\n\nAfter a public outcry, we have finally received some military advisors from our overlord, who has stepped in to help us prepare our own people to retake our territory. They have started discussing ways in which we can utilize our people better militarily, though it will come at certain costs."

A small disappointment, considering what we originally wanted from our overlord, particularly as we will not be able to use our resources as originally planned."

 subject.1003.desc:0 "There are reports of a hawkish movement brewing on [Root.Capital.GetName], with a decorated veteran at its center. Romanticizing a past where we were free to attack and raze other empires, they demand a more warlike agenda to supposedly bring out the best in our own people while weakening our rivals.\n\nWith our current peace - tenuous as it might be - they have quickly found themselves a large following among the poor and within the military. If we consider this to be an issue, our advisors indicate that the movement hinges on its figurehead veteran - remove this problematic element, and the whole movement would fall apart."
 subject.1003.a:0 "Actually, their little agenda lines up with our own plans."
 subject.1003.b:0 "Put an end to it before it gets out of hand."

 subject.1005.title:0 "A Direction for War"
 subject.1005.desc:0 "As they were allowed to continue unabated, the movement demanding a more warlike agenda from our government has only increased in strength the last month. When the conflict between our leadership and the movement came to a head, our [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] publicly embraced the movement.\n\nAs it has become clear that we not only support it, but are ready to follow the many demands handed over to us, the large group of followers are eagerly awaiting what we will do next."

 subject.1052.title:0 "War Exhaustion"
 subject.1052.desc:0 "Though our agreement with [overlord_empire.GetName] is militaristic in nature, we did not expect the atrocious effects it would have on us. Our people are suffering with the constant demands from our overlord, and some of our advisors speculate that if it continues for much longer it will have a permanent impact on our long-term plans."
 subject.1052.desc_gestalt:0 "Though our agreement with the [overlord_empire.GetName] is militaristic in nature, we had neither planned nor foreseen the atrocious impact it would have on us.

If their warlike nature continues unabated, our people are sure to suffer.\n\nIt does not take long before the response from our overlord as well as the details of our current predicament becomes public knowledge, and we see the rise of a small political group opposing the continued rule from [overlord_empire.Capital.GetName]. They are clearly disinterested in appeasing us at all, so what do we truly get from staying loyal to them?"

 ## Event Chain - Technology Advancement
 subject.2005.title:0 "Technological Advancement"
 subject.2005.desc:0 "Thanks to our many deals with [overlord_empire.GetName], we have been able to focus much of our efforts on building and improving the internal workings of our empire. With our scientists and engineers hard at work, we have seen our colonies blossom these last years, as things one would have thought a fantasy only a few years back have suddenly become not only real, but even commonplace.\n\nWe have received news that our wardens in [overlord_empire.GetName] would like to see our latest progress in person, and potentially bring some of it back to their homeland."
 subject.2005.desc_gestalt:0 "Thanks to our many deals with [overlord_empire.GetName], we have been able to focus much of our efforts on building and improving the structure of our empire. With a large segment of our neural network set aside for the task, technologies and feats of engineering never thought possible have now become a commonplace on our planets.\n\nWe have received news that our wardens in [overlord_empire.GetName] would like to see our latest progress in person, and potentially bring some of it back to their homeland."
 subject.2005.a:0 "They are welcome, of course."

 subject.2010.title:0 "A Subject's Duty"
 subject.2010.desc:0 "As the emissary is about to arrive from the [overlord_empire.GetName], we have to decide how willing we are to share our latest designs and creations with our overlord. It would surely be appreciated if we were to do so, but it could be that they will take more direct control of where we will focus our efforts moving forward."
 subject.2010.a:0 "Share it with our overlord nonetheless."
 subject.2010.b:0 "Keep most of it to ourselves."

 subject.2015.title:0 "Technological Advancement"

 ## Event Chain - Destructive Research
 subject.2055.title:0 "Destructive Research"
 subject.2055.desc:0 "On [targeted_planet.GetName], we have have been conducting significant research on the structure of the planet itself to see how one might improve it for our colonies. The latest developments have sadly gone awry, with toxic wastes affecting large swathes of land, leaving them completely uninhabitable.\n\nOur calculations suggest that this is not just one isolated incident, however, and that as long as this extensive planetary research continues, more of these catastrophes are likely to happen."

 subject.2060.desc:0 "As a side effect of the toxic wastes caused by our research on [targeted_planet.GetName], it seems some of the plant and animal life that used to thrive there have gone extinct and caused a chain reaction of issues for a lot of the fauna and flora on the planet. As unexpected as it might have been, those living on [targeted_planet.GetName] have thankfully been mostly unharmed by it, though it has made life harder for them."

 subject.2070.title:0 "Destructive Research - Molten Crisis"
 subject.2070.desc:0 "We have received a report that molten lava has emerged from the crust on [targeted_planet.GetName]. It seems the latest research done on the planet has made it unstable enough that earthquakes have become commonplace these last months, and people have started losing faith in the scientists there.\n\nBy all accounts, it seems our scientists are certain we have hit rock bottom now, both figuratively and literally."
 subject.2070.desc_gestalt:0 "It seems the latest research we have done on [targeted_planet.GetName] has caused even more side-effects to the planet. In the aftermath of a minor earthquake near one of our colonies, molten rocks and gases suddenly surged forth from the earth, turning a situation we had under control into a catastrophe.\n\nWith all of the latest calamities happening on [targeted_planet.GetName], our calculations estimate that we have seen the worst of it by now."

 subject.2105.desc:1 "Our research efforts grow ever more important in light of the continuous stream of demands from the [overlord_empire.GetName]. Many of our scientists struggle with this pressure, but we see glimmers of genius and the occasional amazing breakthrough.\n\nThe latest of these might come from [targeted_scientist.GetName], who has designed a set of daring experiments for one of our departments to undertake. The only problem being that experiments on live [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are part of every single one of their proposals."
 subject.2105.desc_gestalt:0 "We have received yet more demands from the [overlord_empire.GetName], as they want us to improve our research output. Several calculations have been run to figure out how we could live up to our overlord's expectations, and we believe we have found a way to adjust our processes to enable us to do so.\n\nTo go through with it however, we would have to conduct several experiments on our drones and our shared neural network. There will be a significant risk involved."

 subject.2115.desc:0 "An emissary from our overlord has brought explicit orders to put an end to the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] experiments and tests recently begun on [Root.Capital.GetName]. While the message did not state any particular reason as to why, it was unambiguous in its meaning."

 subject.2120.title:0 "Research Accepted"
 subject.2120.desc:0 "While we have not received any communication from our overlord [overlord_empire.GetName], it seems they are aware of the research we have recently begun and have chosen not to intervene in any way.\n\nMoving forward with our plans, we need to figure out what experiments we will undertake next. The more risky and possibly harmful a design, the more potential long-term benefits it might bring our empire."
