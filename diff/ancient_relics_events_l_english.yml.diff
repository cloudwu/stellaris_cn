Once the Zroni population reached a certain critical mass it seems that their collective unconscious minds began to make contact with the proto-shroud in dreams, leading to mass lucid dreaming. Soon the phenomenon was studied and the Zroni discovered how to psionically project themselves into the Shroud, where they found that they could manipulate the very fabric of reality with their psionic powers. It wasn’t long before the Zroni discovered they could physically enter the Shroud and live like Gods, transforming the dimension to suit their whims...\n\nThe Archive's records end there, with no information on what happened to the inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName].

If one can enter the Shroud, it is possible to exit it at any known location. This ability to "Psionically jump" between physical locations allowed the Zroni to spread to all corners of the galaxy, although because they spent most of their time within the Shroud they made few permanent colonies which were mostly located near to their homeworld.\n\n The crystal also gave us the location of another colony."

From what we have learned here, some things are too good to be true, and so it was with the Shroud-granted Godhood of the Zroni. The energy needed to power the vast changes in the Shroud’s composition had to come from somewhere, and it was finally found to originate from the massive black hole at the center of the galaxy. As the Zroni made their changes within the Shroud, so the singularity expanded, consuming the mass of the galactic center and converting it into energy which was siphoned into the Shroud. This discovery shook the Zroni, debate turn to argument, turned to division, turned to civil war between two main factions."

The other faction, "The Saviors", were aghast at this- the Zroni could not destroy the galaxy to live as parasitic gods! Even outside of the Shroud, their Psionic abilities guaranteed them a utopian existence.\n\n The location of another Zroni colony was also discovered."

Desiring to grow stronger, these entities had began to subtly influence the emotions and thoughts of suitable Zroni, slowly causing their behaviors to become more extreme which may have caused the Zroni civil war.\n\nWe also discovered a reference to the location of one of the Zroni's major colonies."

The discovery of an irradiated, ruined complex that once stored vats of highly radioactive chemicals has confirmed the theory that the lost species of mutants subjected themselves willingly to excess radiation, in a sort of coming of age ritual tied to their spiritual faith.\n\nIn what must have been a painful ceremonial procedure, members of this long-lost society on [From.Planet.GetName] would expose themselves to near-lethal doses of chemical mutagens, in the hopes of revealing their 'true selves.' The skeletal remains found at the bottom of many of these vats suggest not all supplicants survived the ordeal."

The fate of the alien engineers who built it is unclear, as they no longer inhabit the planet.\n\nTheir machinery span the majority of the surface of the planet, crisscrossing mountains and oceans alike, and even extends far below the planet's surface, in a vast network of underground facilities. It has been constructed using identical materials and serial codes, suggesting a single institution created the entire network. From the long-overgrown agricultural sectors, to the collapsed energy generation and transformation systems and extensive communication arrays, all of the industrial and entertainment needs of this planet's lost inhabitants were met by this one supermachine.\n\nRemarkably, some of these mechanical sectors are still functional, sending and receiving local signals, lighting up long-rotted ghost towns, and watering great swathes of what must have once been agricultural land. Deep scans of the planet's crust suggest the sprawling machine's control center is located underground -- we will have to excavate if we wish to reach it.\n\nAs for the strange organic tissue covering most of the planet-spanning machinery, our science team thus far remains baffled by its nature, and its purpose."

Owing to their discovery of medicine and the civilization's scientific progress, the citizens gradually became aware they were, in fact, living within the digestive chamber of a much larger species. The citizens launched a magnificent war, arming every member of the city in an attempt to destroy the creature - but it was all for naught. Th turmoil in the gigantic arthropod's lower gut caused it to undergo severe peristalsis, leading to the entire civilization of tiny city-dwellers to be regurgitated up into the arthropod's stomach. Subsequently, the entire city's populace was promptly dissolved by their host's more virulent stomach acids.\n\nThe creature perished millennia later, from simple old age."
