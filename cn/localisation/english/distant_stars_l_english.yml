After being hunted to near extinction by nightmarish beings referred to as 'Vessels', they fled their homeworld in search of a distant paradise planet - the mythical promised land Paridayda, that would reveal itself only to the chosen ones. Judging by the state of their ship, however, their attackers caught up with them.\n\nShall we extract the ship's navigational drive and decrypt its destination?"

As it turns out the ancient alien blueprints and manuals were riddled with miscalculations so severe that the platform would have been inoperable.\n\nLuckily the mistakes were caught in time and the strength of the beams has since been calibrated, and the solar wind outflow stabilized."

 distar.3000.b:0 "Probe it."
 distar.3000.b.tooltip:0 "Dispatch a drill probe to retrieve a sample."
 distar.3001.desc:0 "Caution proved well in order. Hidden inside [trojan_asteroid.GetName] was a host of old mining drones programmed to attack on sight.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] fortunately detected this early and was able to jam the drones' sensors long enough to disable them.\n\nThe drones' cores are old indeed, but retain vast amounts of energy for siphoning."
 distar.3002.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName]'s forceful probing proved unfortunate. Within the asteroid was hidden a host of old mining drones, programmed to attack on sight.\n\nThe drones have picked up on the [Root.GetName]'s presence and are beginning to stir.\n\nThere may still be time for an evasive maneuver, if [Root.GetName] acts quickly."

The [Root.GetName]'s crew is unsure how to classify the lifeform, but its ability to survive, seemingly without any sustenance, is truly astonishing. Considering the planet's age, it is not impossible that the organism has been fighting its habitat's toxicity for millennia, though this is an educated guess at best.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has requested permission to retrieve samples of the unknown organism, so that it may be studied."

Since then its language has developed at a spectacular rate and it's now able to successfully convey the seven primary emotions - and does so often to its own spawn. It reproduces - by spreading its spores - as a matter of routine, and the laboratory will soon be insufficient to house the fungoids.\n\nThe $NAME_Nivlac$ still has not shown any signs of aggression."

 distar.3030.desc:0 "A closer look at [molluscoid_miners_planet.GetName] has shown that its hut-like structures are home to a molluscoid species. The huts are crude shelters, built out of soil and quasi-fecal excretions.\n\nThe molluscoids appear semi-sapient with limited intelligence. Besides survival, their society and lives revolve around unearthing minerals which are then put on display, seemingly to raise the social standing of the finder.\n\nTheir means of locating these minerals remain unclear, however, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is baffled by their ability to locate large deposits of minerals.\n\nThough technologically inferior, studying these molluscoids may well further our mining capabilities."
 distar.3030.a:0 "Intriguing. Study them further."
 distar.3030.b:0 "Mine their minerals."

 distar.3031.desc:0 "The molluscoids inhabiting [molluscoid_miners_planet.GetName] employ a strange method to locate their coveted minerals.\n\nApparently their skin naturally produces gelatinous secretions which seep into the porous soil, trickling ever downward while remaining attached to their skin as long strings. These secretions effectively sample the soil, feeding back sensory information to the molluscoid individual as long as the slimy strands remain unbroken. In this manner, they are able to map out surprisingly large parts of the underground terrain and map out mineral veins.\n\nIf we were to integrate the molluscoids into our society, or simply advance our production processes with this knowledge, it is likely our mining enterprises would benefit greatly."
 distar.3031.a:0 "Granted. Begin the integration."

 distar.3033.name:0 "Mineral Mapping"
 distar.3033.desc:0 "A system enabling us to quickly chart underground terrain and the minerals it contains has been implemented.\n\nBy analyzing planetary reflection of particular solar and cosmic rays, which are unable to penetrate most minerals, we can gather data on the crust's mineral composition. This makes it possible to essentially x-ray a target body, be it an asteroid or part of a planet.\n\nOur scientists have dubbed it Mineral Mapping, and it should greatly improve our mineral production."

 ### Alien Machine ###

 distar.3040.desc:0 "Further scans suggest the machine is still operational, though its purpose remains entirely unclear.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has never seen anything like it. Some of its materials look familiar, but most are strange and utterly alien as the design of its components.\n\nThe machine has what appears to be a console, with one item in particular standing out: a large crooked lever of unknown material."

 distar.3041.name:0 "Alien Machine"
 distar.3041.desc:0 "It is unclear what happened when the machine's lever was pulled.\n\nIts console flickered, powerful vibrations could be felt, and then a wave of energy surged from the machine, expanding outwards into deep space. The scientists close by felt this wave push past them, but experienced no other sensory evidence of its passing.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is unsure what to make of it. The machine itself returned to its inactive state immediately thereafter, and no longer returns any energy readings."

 distar.3042.desc:1 "An enormous spike in energy readings from a nearby solar system has been observed.\n\nOur scientists are worried about what could have caused such a prodigious energy pulse. The common hypothesis appear to be that of a supernova or, though unlikely, a tear in the very fabric of space-time, such as a wormhole.\n\nScience Officer [unknown_machine_science_ship.GetLeaderName] has pointed out that this curiously occurred soon after the activation of the strange machine found on [asteroid_target.GetName].\n\nWe should make haste to explore nearby systems, such as §Y[system_one.GetName]§!."

 ### Orbital Speed Demon ###
 distar.3050.name:0 "Orbital Speed Demon"
 distar.3050.desc:0 "Attempts to scan the object in high-speed orbit of [From.GetName] have been unsuccessful. The object quickly falls below [From.GetName]'s horizon and the [Root.GetName]'s instruments are simply unable to keep up.\n\nWhile [From.GetName]'s gravitational pull is strong, that alone does little to explain the object's extreme momentum. Either the object itself possesses some extraordinary properties, or there is some gravitational phenomenon at work here.\n\nThe object's velocity appears to be increasing over time, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] suspects that it may soon be thrown out of orbit, even without outside interference."
 distar.3050.a:0 "Try to slow it down."
 distar.3050.a.tooltip:0 "Dispatch a drone and attempt to latch onto the object to reduce its momentum."

 distar.3050.c:0 "Get away from it."
 distar.3050.c.tooltip:0 "Move out of harm's way and leave the object to its fate."
 distar.3051.name:0 "Speed Demon Halted"

Sprinklers douse the room in liquid and an electrical surge passes through it executing all living things. Here the footage ends. Our crew can confirm that the strong box was indeed empty."

 distar.2045.desc:0 "The signal originates from a gathering of destroyed military vessels in orbit around [From.GetName]. It seems a foreign alien power predating our civilization by many thousand years, called the Sujin Empire, was attempting to hijack the gateway network using some kind of interference beam, when they were rudely interrupted. Though the beam is active and calibrated on the gateway's security network, it has been damaged in the assault. Perhaps our scientists could mend it."
