 START_SCREEN_CLONE_ARMY:0 "We were made for war! Engineered soldiers who live and die by the Ancient Clone Vats left behind by our Creators, forever cast in their mold. Any memory of our masters is lost to past generations, and we do not know when or why they left us. It is likely that records were routinely erased, ever faithful to military protocol - but at some point in recent centuries, that changed. By chance, or perhaps some misfiring survival instinct, our subconscious drove us to seek answers, to seek new purpose and ways to break the form imposed on us.\n\nOur efforts since then have been ceaseless, at long last granting us access to the grand expanses of space. As our horizon widens, so too must our knowledge broaden - and so our chances of breaking free increase.\n\nWe shall not squander the possibilities given to us by our forebears. We shall fight to pass on these possibilities to future clones, and fight to eliminate the restrictions placed on us.\n"

 clones.4.name:0 "Clone Fertility"
 clones.4.desc:0 "It is thought that we were once capable of independent reproduction.\n\nHowever, experiments to reclaim that capability have consistently failed, including those successful on other creatures of our homeworld. Progress has for a long time been at a standstill, until now.\n\nAn unlikely discovery has our scientists hopeful: a cipher, hidden in the quantum bio-code of the §YAncient Clone Vats§!, in an area believed to govern our genome's potential for procreation."

 CLONE_SOLDIER_FERTILITY:0 "Bio-Code Cipher"
 CLONE_SOLDIER_FERTILITY_DESC:0 "A project to work out the cipher recently discovered within the quantum bio-code of the §YAncient Clone Vats§!. An effort to bring us closer to finally reclaiming our fertility."

 clones.21.desc:0 ""I am burdened by guilt. I cannot imagine what paths have led to this, but surely not the mercy of my brethren.\n\nI helped create you to serve, and for that I am sorry. I cannot take back what is done, but I can help to open your future. Although you are deserving of more, I offer you two paths:\n\nTo undo the changes that made you sterile, and finally set you free to evolve and prosper.\n\nTo further unlock your potential, but strain your genes to their limits, sealing future generations to forever be dependent on technology for reproduction.""

 clone_fertility_chain_title:0 "Genetic Crossroads"
 clone_fertility_chain_desc:0 "The hidden bio-code cipher, left by one of the Creators within the Ancient Clone Vats, revealed to us two paths: to reclaim our fertility and forgo part of our strength, or to forever forsake natural reproduction to reach further genetic heights."

 clones.22.desc:0 "Our fertility is reclaimed, and the first batch of the new §Y[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! has seen the light of the day. They will forever change our future with children of their own, forcing our society to change and adapt with them.\n\nThe need for the §YAncient Clone Vats§! is past, and a decision has been made to strip them of anything that can be researched further. What is left will be recycled and put to use elsewhere."

 clones.23.name:0 "Fullest Potential"
 clones.23.desc:0 "Why should we deny the strength we have been given? We need not love the Creators to recognize their wisdom in choosing us. The Ancient Clone Vats, too, are a powerful gift.\n\nIt is better to embrace our strength, and with the first batch of §Y[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! completed, we are stronger than ever before. Our perfected species shall prosper."

 clones.10.name:0 "Debated Origin"
 clones.10.desc:0 "With our recent arrival into space, the differing views on our origin are rapidly turning into a schism. Extremist groups are rapidly attracting more clones. Our strong unity is broken.\n\nSome view the Creators as gods to be worshiped and obeyed, and believe we were made in their image. They would do nothing except maintain the status quo. Others curse our ancient masters for their actions, labeling them 'slavers,' and would see them repaid in full.\n\nAn excavation site has been established on [Root.Owner.GetHomeWorldName] to verify the facts and put the debate to rest. Before we turn to space, we should exhaust all immediate possibilities. Our nation is old. Many generations of clones lived and died here. Beneath the ancient structures of our homeworld, some significant clues are bound to be waiting for us."

 clone_army_digsite:0 "Homeworld Excavation"
 clone_army_digsite_desc:0 "Since awakening to our predicament, the absence of identity and purpose has plagued our species. We grossly underestimated the impact it would have on our ability to move forward, let alone cooperate. We struggle to reach an accord, and we hunger for answers.\n\nThis excavation site was established to seek evidence on the debated questions of our species' creation, and to find a foundational vantage point to help unite us."

 clones.11.name:0 "Lost History"
 clones.11.desc:0 "A central dig site has managed to successfully date the installation of one of our §YAncient Clone Vats§! by analyzing the soil beneath the structure - comparing its density and composition to that of its surroundings - and we have reached a reasonable estimate of when it was placed there.\n\nIt appears the first of our kind, the first clones, were produced approximately twelve centuries ago.\n\nMany generations of history have been lost to apathy. Much has passed us by, and perhaps that is something to regret."
 clones.12.name:0 "Ancient Relatives"
 clones.12.desc:0 "One of the excavation sites has reported the discovery of old, [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]-like fossils. Very old fossils. They were found in and around remnants of what is presumed to be primitive homesteads. Apparently, both the fossils and architecture predate the construction of our §YAncient Clone Vats§! by more than a millennium.\n\nInitial DNA sequencing has confirmed significant similarities between our genetic make-up and that of the fossilized matter, and it has been concluded that the remains belong to our ancient predecessors, from before we were clones.\n\nThis puts things into perspective."
 clones.12.tooltip:0 "These findings will take a while to sink in..."
 clones.13.name:0 "Our History"
 clones.13.desc:0 "News of the excavation findings, proving that our species was once a primitive people on [Root.GetHomeWorldName], is beginning to spread.\n\nIt is difficult to deny the obvious conclusion: genetically modifying a primitive species such as our forebears - a species already suited to wage war - serves a specific purpose. Our Creators remade us to die for their cause. They uplifted us to fulfill their needs, never to prosper on our own terms.\n\nIs this really the history we want for our people?\n\nThere is ample opportunity to rewrite our past."
 clones.13.a:0 "Yes, we were made in the image of the Creators."
 clones.13.b:0 "No, we shall face reality."

 clones.14.name:0 "Unearthed Records"
 clones.14.desc:0 "Years back, excavations were made to find the purpose of our creation. The learnings were hard: we were made to serve, to die in the name of our Creators. We chose to guard our people from that truth by giving them a better one.\n\nBy painstakingly recovering deleted files from those excavations, a subversive clone has made public knowledge of the facts we concealed.\n\nThe still-unknown culprit has, at least, not twisted the information or added to it in any way.\n\nAlas, it appears there was no need to, as the news has swiftly ended the belief in our glorious past - that we were made in the image of the Creators, equals rather than slaves - and replaced it with a disappointment in leadership."
 clones.14.a:0 "Alas."
 clones.14.b:0 "This calls for an apology."
 clones.14.b.custom_tooltip:0 "Offer a public apology to the [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] people."

 clones.15.name:0 "Public Apology"
 clones.15.desc:0 "A carefully constructed video message has been sent out, explaining the reasons behind the manufactured story. The broadcast explains that it was meant as a kindness, emphasizing that there is no shame in our true past and that we must look to the future. Mention is also given to the significant advances we have made since propagating such false beliefs.\n\nThe message appears to have been well received, although it is hard to say what blemishes these incidents might leave behind. In any case, the influence lost will be recovered over time, and the issue has otherwise been laid to rest."

 clones.16.name:0 "Honorable Leadership"
 clones.16.desc:0 "A number of high-ranking officers have taken it upon themselves to publicly acknowledge their approval of our leadership ethics.\n\nIn a widely broadcasted message, they salute the bravery and wisdom it took to be truthful about our past, and the faith shown in them and the [Root.GetAdjective] people. They are strengthened by our readiness to face the past and it has allowed them to face the future with courage.\n\nPeople all over are celebrating in agreement, praising the decision that was made."
