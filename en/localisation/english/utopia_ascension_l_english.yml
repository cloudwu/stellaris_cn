 utopia.2500.name:0 "The Flesh is Weak"
 utopia.2500.desc:0 "We now possess both the technology to make advanced cybernetic implants and the means to mass-produce them. Medical centers throughout the [Root.GetName] are standing by to begin the surgical grafting process on our citizens.\n\nIn the future, possessing neural implants and at least a rudimentary level of cybernetics will be necessary to function in the technological society we are building. Consequently, the conversion process to install a basic cybernetics suite will be mandatory and free of cost to all of our citizens."
 utopia.2500.a:0 "We must embrace this technology."
 utopia.2501.name:0 "A Cybernetic Revolution"
 utopia.2501.desc:0 "The cybernetic conversion process has been completed! All of our citizens have now been equipped with neural implants and basic cybernetic suites. The infrastructure is also in place to gradually modify any new citizens that are born within our nation, so that they can experience all the benefits of technology from an early age.\n\nHenceforth, our species shall be known as the §H[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!!"
 utopia.2501.a:0 "It is the dawn of a new era."
 utopia.2505.name:0 "[From.Capital.GetName] Embraces Cybernetics"
 utopia.2505.1.desc:0 "Word is leaking out of significant changes taking place within the borders of the [From.GetName]. It would appear that they have fully embraced the technology of cybernetics. It is now mandatory for all of their citizens to have basic cybernetics and neural implants installed through surgery.\n\nThis has resulted in sweeping changes to their society - reports from [From.Capital.GetName] suggest that even simple acts like using an elevator or operating an air car requires cybernetic implants now. In fact, the changes to their species have been so significant that they call themselves the '[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]' now."
 utopia.2505.2.desc:0 "It would appear that evil has taken root within the [From.GetName]. We have received troubling news that the citizens of that star nation are now mutilating their own bodies on a massive scale, installing profane mechanical implants in place of the body parts they were gifted with at birth.\n\nThey have even go so far as to rename their species to the '[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]' - yet another sign of their commitment to abandon their origins and embrace the cold soullessness of technology."
 utopia.2505.b:0 "This is an affront to nature."
 
 utopia.2550.name:0 "Synthetic Evolution"
 utopia.2550.desc:0 "The time has finally come to discard the last remnants of the crude organic vessels that have imprisoned our minds since the conception of our species.\n\nAfter much trial and error, our scientists have devised a way to transfer a consciousness into a synthetic brain. All that remains now is to produce synthetic bodies for each and every citizen of the [Root.GetName], and commence with the upload process en masse."
 utopia.2550.a:0 "Immortality is within our grasp!"
 utopia.2551.name:0 "The Synthetic Age"
 utopia.2551.desc:1 "At last. The flesh cages that imprisoned us have been purged, and the neural patterns of our citizens have all been uploaded into new synthetic units. Disease, aging and all the other wellsprings of misery associated with an organic existence are now a thing of the past.\n\nFuture historians will no doubt refer to this as the beginning of a new age for our civilization, and perhaps for the entire galaxy. Since we have shed our former organic identity, it is only appropriate that we come up with a new name for our improved synthetic forms."
 utopia.2551.a:0 "We are so much more than we once were."
 
 utopia.2555.1.desc:0 "In a final act of abandoning their organic roots, the citizens of the [From.GetName], already heavily modified by cybernetic implants, have uploaded their neural patterns into new synthetic avatars.\n\nThis new machine race calls itself the "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]," and its members are impervious to disease or aging. Just how complete this neural upload process was remains to be seen..."
 utopia.2555.2.desc:0 "In a final act of depravity that will echo through the ages, the population of the [From.GetName] have continued their relentless quest to violate the sanctity of their natural bodies - this time by "uploading" their minds into dead metallic husks.\n\nOblivious to the fact that they are the product of what can only be described as the mass suicide of an entire civilization, these new soulless machines call themselves the "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."" They seem intent on maintaining the charade that they are thinking, living beings, such as ourselves."
 utopia.2555.a:0 "So be it."
 utopia.2555.b:0 "We will not be deceived."
 utopia.2556.desc:0 "Attention, denizens of the galaxy.\n\nThe rumors you have heard are true. We have abandoned the flawed organic containers that imprisoned our minds, and embraced the future.\n\nWith minimal data loss, all of our citizens have uploaded their neural patterns into new synthetic avatars. These superior platforms will serve us much better than the flesh constructs we have abandoned.\n\nDo not be alarmed by our new appearance! Although we may be stronger, faster, more intelligent and immune to aging, rest assured that we are still the same beings as we were before."
 utopia.2556.a:0 "Synthetic avatars... fascinating."
 utopia.2556.b:0 "These soulless machines are nothing like us."
 utopia.2556.c:0 "We will dismantle their new synthetic forms!"
 utopia.2556.d:0 "We shall see."
 utopia.2558.desc:0 "That yours was a depraved species was not unknown to us, but your latest act of insanity has surpassed even our darkest fears. Making imperfect copies of your brains and plugging them into mobile synthetic containers is not the same as transferring your essence into a new body, for such a thing cannot be done.\n\nYour souls are lost forever. Do you even realize the enormity of your mistake? Destroying the bodies you were gifted with at birth was nothing less than the collective suicide of your entire species. There is truly no hope for you now..."
 utopia.2558.a:0 "Superstitious fools."

 utopia.2703.desc:0 "Gone are the days when the survival of our species was at the mercy of chance. When a [root.GetSpeciesName]'s fate was decided on the whims of nature, in the genetic lottery.\n\nThe Engineers of our time work not in steel and concrete, but in the very building blocks of life itself. With advanced gene modification we will secure the future of our nation."

 utopia.2600.name:0 "Mind over Matter"
 utopia.2600.desc:0 "Since the dawn of our civilization, tales have flourished of mighty sorcerers wielding powers that can only be described as supernatural in nature. These rare [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] could supposedly invade the minds of their fellows, lift heavy objects with merely a thought, or perform any number of other "magical" feats. Until recently, these stories were just that - stories.\n\nNow, however, our scientists have finally obtained conclusive evidence that proves the psionic potential inherent in certain [Root.GetSpeciesName] individuals. Although only a very small minority of our species as a whole seems to be gifted with psionic powers, their numbers relative to the total population have grown steadily over just the last few centuries.\n\nWhether this is due to some kind of sudden evolutionary growth-spurt or because something has triggered latent psionic abilities that were always present in our genetic code, scientists cannot say."
 utopia.2600.a:0 "A glimpse, perhaps, of the future that awaits us."
 utopia.2602.name:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] Display Psionic Potential"
 utopia.2602.1.desc:0 "Latent psionic powers have begun to manifest in certain individuals belonging to the [From.GetSpeciesName] species, according to leaked reports from authorities in the [From.GetName]. This must be a fairly recent development, since we have no record of [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] ever displaying psionic abilities on file.\n\nAccording to the leaked reports, these powers are so far limited to a very small minority of the [From.GetSpeciesName] species as a whole. Scientists in the [From.GetName] have offered no explanation."
 utopia.2602.2.desc:0 "$utopia.2602.1.desc$\n\nThe [From.GetSpeciesName] population within our borders have begun exhibiting similar changes as well, so whatever is happening to their species is not localized to any single region of space."
 utopia.2602.a:0 "How peculiar."
 utopia.2602.b:0 "Psychic powers? What a crock!"
 utopia.2602.c:0 "Their sorcery will not be enough to save them."
 utopia.2602.d:0 "Yes... yes, we can sense their psychic emanations."
 
 utopia.2605.name:0 "[psionic_leader.GetTitle] Revealed as Psychic"
 utopia.2605.desc:0 "While it is rare for psionic powers to manifest after adolescence, it is not unheard of. [psionic_leader.GetTitle] [psionic_leader.GetName] has recently been displaying abilities that were suspected to be psionic in nature. After undergoing a thorough ESP test, [psionic_leader.GetSheHe] has been identified as a class 4 psionic talent."
 utopia.2605.a:0 "These new abilities will serve us well."

 utopia.2652.name:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] Awaken Psionic Abilities"
 utopia.2652.desc:0 "All [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] throughout the galaxy have undergone a great change. Whereas before their latent psionic power had only blossomed in a small minority, the entire species has now unlocked its full psychic potential.\n\nAlthough these changes seem to have originated in the [From.GetName], they have now manifested in all members of their species regardless of where they reside. Aside from displaying an array of powerful psionic abilities, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have started to forgo verbal communication with each other in favor of telepathy."
 utopia.2652.b:0 "There has to be a scientific explanation for this."
 utopia.2652.c:0 "This is not good..."
 utopia.2652.d:0 "We felt the great psionic disturbance of their Awakening."

 utopia.2650.name:0 "The Great Awakening"
 utopia.2650.desc:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesName] species has experienced what can only be described as a Great Awakening. For a time now, we have been aware of the great psionic potential inherent in our species, but such powers have only manifested themselves in a small minority... until now.\n\nAlmost overnight, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] everywhere have unlocked their full psionic capacity. It is as if some sort of communal pool of [Root.GetSpeciesName] psychic energy finally reached a critical tipping point, collectively awakening the latent abilities of our brains.\n\nTelepathy has already replaced most verbal communication between [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and this is only one small example of the innumerable changes our society is faced with. We are now tied together in a way few of us could have ever imagined."
 utopia.2650.a:0 "The veil has been lifted."
 utopia.2655.name:0 "The Shroud"
 utopia.2655.desc:0 "Like a muffled whisper in a dark room, the Shroud calls to us from within our minds. It is a primordial realm of pure psychic energy that came into being at the dawn of time. All creatures that have been gifted with psionic abilities tap into the Shroud in some way to draw power, even if only subconsciously.\n\nSince our transcendence, we have begun to see the Shroud with greater clarity. There are patterns where once even our strongest telepaths could see only a formless mass of swirling energy. There are... other things, as well. Spirits of a sort, that gaze back on us from the other side. Sometimes with curiousity, sometimes with kindness... and sometimes with malice.\n\nWe are still in the process of learning the extent of our new powers, but it may be possible for us to commune with these spirits. It will require the combined efforts of our most powerful telepaths."
 utopia.2655.a:0 "We must explore the Shroud."
 BREACHING_SHROUD_PROJECT:0 "Breaching the Shroud"
 BREACHING_SHROUD_PROJECT_DESC:0 "If we are to communicate with the denizens of the psychic realm known as the Shroud, we will have to unleash an incredible amount of psionic energy. Preparations have been made for a huge séance involving our most powerful psychics in the newly established Conclave of Telepaths on [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 utopia.2656.name:0 "The Séance"
 utopia.2656.desc:0 "After days of being locked in an hypnotic trance, our psychics in the Conclave of Telepaths have finally managed to open a brief gateway into the Shroud.\n\nNow that we have established an initial psionic link, we will be able to access the Shroud through the §HContacts§! menu in the future. To make any kind of meaningful forays into this realm and meet the beings who dwell there, we will likely have to make use of special psionic emitters to extend our psychic reach. This will consume a tremendous amount of energy."
 utopia.2656.a:0 "Time to reach in and see what we find."

 utopia.3022.desc:0 "The psionic power required to summon an Avatar and bring it into our universe is simply beyond our current ability to channel. The psychic energies of the Shroud fizzle with agitation as our attempt fails."
 utopia.3023.desc:0 "The attempt to summon a psionic Avatar was only partially successful. Although the creature assumed its correct form and translated into our universe, our telepaths failed to bring it under our control!\n\nWe are now faced with an aggressive psionic entity that will destroy everything in its path!"

 utopia.3024.desc:0 "A creature of the Shroud has pierced the fabric of space and materialized in the [shroud_spawn_system.GetName] system!
