ADD situation.150.desc:0 "Our colonists on [Root.GetName] report a strange phenomenon: snow has begun gathering outside of one of their main colonial settlements.\n\nWell, "snow" is the term they have used to describe it, anyway. It would seem implausible that it is real snow, given that [Root.GetName] is a desert planet where temperatures are seldom below freezing, even in the polar regions. Besides, there were no sightings of it actually falling from the sky. Nevertheless, initial readings suggest that the substance does indeed consist mainly of frozen water - though quite why it's not melting is unclear. Our [Root.Owner.GetResearchers] are eager to investigate its properties, but others caution that it may be dangerous and want it removed."
ADD situation.155.name:0 "Spreading Chills"
ADD situation.155.desc:1 "The snow on [Target.GetName] has been multiplying. The initial small patch has swelled to cover an ever-expanding area of the desert, to the point that it is interfering with our transport and cultivation networks. If it does not stop growing soon, there are growing concerns that the colony will be unable to continue to support itself.\n\nOur [Owner.GetResearchers] on the planet have sought, in vain, to explain the phenomenon. When removed from the main body, the snow quickly melts, leaving behind only some organic matter. Our [Owner.GetResearchers] theorize that this residue is causing the snow to maintain its integrity, sheltering it from heat via an unknown chemical reaction. However, they caution that this is only their best guess, and they have managed to find out very little about the strange compound."

While we are able to remove small parts of it from the main body and melt it in that manner, this has done little to halt its onward march, and more invasive attempts to destroy it have so far failed - a spate of mysterious mechanical failures has surrounded the entire effort.\n\nWhat is worse, there have been increasing reports of colonists disappearing in areas affected by the snow. It seems likely that they are connected and the snow is alive - and malicious."

However, more level heads point out that it has been a nuisance rather than a menace so far, and it has avoided directly occupying inhabited areas. They posit that it is clearly alive, and argue that we should seek to open dialog with it.\n\nEither way, our room for maneuver is rapidly shrinking."
