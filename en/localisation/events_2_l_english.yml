 anomaly.75.desc:0 "A scan of the particularly massive asteroid [From.GetName] yields fascinating results. The rock's core is shot through with a network of conductive crystals carrying a weak electric charge. The crew on the [Root.GetName] recognize this matrix as a primitive neural lattice and believe the celestial body to be thinking in some capacity, if not fully sentient. They seek permission to excavate the core and transport it to the nearest orbital station for closer study."

 anomaly.85.desc:0 "Irregular electromagnetic bursts from [From.GetName] and its neighboring planets intrigue the crew of the [Root.GetName]. Further study reveals that the bursts are coded communications, though the contents are fairly banal.

 anomaly.91.name:0 "Grassy Militia"
 anomaly.91.desc:0 "Careful examination reveals that the violent behavior of the vines and grasses of [From.From.GetName] is no dumb self-defense reflex.\n\nThe plants have a complex internal social order.

 anomaly.125.desc:0 "Intercepting the distress signal, the [Root.GetName] sends a probe down to the volatile surface of [From.GetName].

 anomaly.130.name:0 "Gravity Crush"
 anomaly.130.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName]'s survey of the asteroid is temporarily halted as a probe is caught by an errant gravitational anomaly.\n\nThe probe manages to transmit some data before it is brutally crushed by the extreme forces - forces that completely dissipate soon after."
 anomaly.130.a:0 "At least no one got hurt."
 anomaly.135.name:0 "Abandoned Amusement Park"
 anomaly.135.desc:0 "The structures on [From.GetName] are not as old as we first believed. It seems to be a playground or amusement park of some sort. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] notes that many of the contraptions are highly complex creations that we can learn much from and that, to the builders' alien eyes, this might have been a cutting-edge sensor array, or even a gigantic art installation.\n\nRegardless, to us [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural], it looks mostly like a place where you would take your young and let them amuse themselves."
 anomaly.140.name:0 "Familiar Shrine"
 anomaly.140.desc:0 "Most of the asteroid been laser-chiseled, with great precision, into the likeness of a small [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] temple, or large shrine.\n\nA shrine to the Untold, the great destroyer-deity of old [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] faiths.\n\nThe temple has been tumbling through the quiet of space for far longer than we have been capable of space-flight, which is... disturbing, at best.\n\nTerrifying at worst.\n\nNaturally, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] urges us to search for more stellar objects that match the characteristics of this space-temple, and has uploaded a list of likely candidates in nearby systems to the Situation Log."

 anomaly.145.name:0 "What Music They Make"
 anomaly.145.desc:0 "The animals of [From.GetName], predator and prey alike, gather together as night falls and...\n\nSing.\n\nThe howls, clicks, chirps, roars and hisses are discordant to say the least, but there is a recognizable melody in there. And not a bad one either, to hear the crew of the [Root.GetName] tell it.\n\nThe non-sentient choir is obviously the work of some alien entity, and we may never know their purpose in altering the fauna of [From.GetName] in this way.\n\nWe may, however, be able to at least start to figure out how they did it."
 anomaly.150.name:0 "Below Zro"
 anomaly.150.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is not only an ice giant, but an ice giant of made up of very unusual ices. There are pockets of Zro trapped in the within reach of the upper levels of the planet's atmosphere."
 anomaly.155.name:0 "Illicit Matter"
 anomaly.155.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] finds a disturbing tangle of technology hidden in a deep crater on the asteroid's surface.\n\nEvidently someone has, with rather simple means, managed to stabilize a one-way wormhole, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] quickly asserts that the asteroid is the exit point. The other end opens up somewhere in uncharted space some light-years away from a black hole, and small quantities of dark matter are leaking - being siphoned - through the wormhole.\n\nWhoever set this up seems to have abandoned the operation."
 anomaly.160.name:0 "Purple Rain"
 anomaly.160.desc:0 "Images capturing [From.GetName]'s mesmerizing purple-colored rain, taken by the [Root.GetName]'s surface exploration probes, somehow find their way into the hands of the cultural elite on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName].\n\nWhile the discovery is of no scientific value, the evocative imagery of the colorful precipitation sparks a minor renaissance in the [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] art world, the positive effects of which shall be felt for years to come."
 anomaly.165.name:0 "Old Gods: Shrine to the Benefactress"
 anomaly.165.desc:0 "Deciphering the pictograms in the Benefactress' shrine was a much smoother process than anticipated. All linguists involved describe the language quickly "connecting" or "clicking" in their minds, despite its age and complexity.\n\nHowever, the writings are unlikely to make much sense until they are combined with the other writs associated with the rest of the quadrumvirate godhead."
 anomaly.166.name:0 "Old Gods: Shrine to the Undaunted"
 anomaly.166.desc:1 "After days of activities that can best be termed "fiddling", Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has retrieved the doctrine of the Undaunted, a textile scroll coated with a sturdy plastic polymer."
 anomaly.167.name:0 "Old Gods: Shrine to the Percipient"
 anomaly.167.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has reported back with the [Root.GetName]'s findings at the Percipient's shrine. They recognized early on that a text in some logographic script is inlaid in the walls, heavily distorted by the layers of translucent lacquer.\n\nInitial attempts at unscrambling the text, relying on the raw processing power of the [Root.GetName]'s computers to reconstruct the text from plain images, proved fruitless as it was simply too distorted to place in any known lingual family tree. Next, the crew of the [Root.GetName] attempted bombarding the lacquer with light of varying wavelengths and intensity, but no beneficial reactions were observed. [Root.GetLeaderName] apparently considered physically separating the lacquer from the inlaid text, but realized that the strange glyphs would doubtlessly have been made misshapen to begin with, only to assume their proper shape when viewed correctly through the lens of the lacquer.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] was about to call the mission a failure when, looking up as they irritably paced along the edges of the circular space, they realized that discrete lines of cohesive text were momentarily forming before their eyes, melting away only to be replaced by new lines.\n\nNot long after they had the ceiling, walls and floor imaged in a spiral pattern. Texts from other shrines should help us piece it all together."

 anomaly.168.desc:0 "The complete doctrine of the gods - for that is what the recovered texts have to be regarded as, dwarfing the fairy-tale scraps upon which the old [Root.GetSpeciesName] religions were founded - is as shockingly revelatory as it is revolutionary.\n\nWith only a little bit of creative interpretation, it is clear that the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] were meant for great things, guided by the strong hand of a religious leader.\n\nOur path is one to godhood, but our past is littered with prophecies unfulfilled and sin born of ignorance. Redemption is ephemeral."

It is staffed by one [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] scientist, a fairly talented and industrious one if their research on [From.GetName] is anything to go by. There is a problem with regards to their identity however; we have been unable to match them against official state records, and they refuse to identify themselves save for stating that they are "an exile".\n\nThey have expressed an interest in returning to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] and serving the [Root.Owner.GetName] directly, on the condition that the [Root.GetName] immediately depart [From.GetName] and no [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] ships ever return there."

The equipment - functional, cheap, intended to be abandoned - is well-used, and the local databanks are filled with detailed but ultimately mundane accounts of the planet as well as the simple experiments that were carried out in its harsh environment.\n\nCuriously, no closer examination seems to have been made of the mineral outcropping the outpost's foundations rest on; scans by the [Root.GetName] indicate that the geological formation, a mountain mostly buried under ice, may be partially hollow. More alarmingly, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the sole inhabitant of the outpost, the mysterious "exile", has gone missing and is nowhere to be found."

The structure itself is commonplace enough - a temporary shelter erected against the harsh elements, allowing surface-level planetary study for a limited time before it wears down and conditions become untenable - but it is situated on top of a rocky formation poking through the sea of ice that covers the planet.\n\nThe crew of the [Root.GetName] found an intricate system of caves and narrow passages leading into this mountain, accessible from inside the research outpost.\n\nIn one of the larger cavern-halls, they found the desiccated remains of the outpost's original staff. This contingent of [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] researchers had originally been dispatched elsewhere, but evidently diverted to this uninhabited and hostile planet to set up shop.\n\nOf course, the self-proclaimed "exile" is now nowhere to be found.

A chemical compound, found in the surface ice layers in several regions of [From.From.GetName], is allegedly, supposedly, closely related to [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] Stellar Salt, an ingredient integral to many traditional [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] dishes and thought extinct on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName]. It has long been speculated that [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] Stellar Salt was never native to our homeworld, but was brought to the surface by some meteorite impacts in the distant past. The Science Officer's discovery on [From.GetName] lends some credence to this theory, though [Root.GetLeaderName] leans heavily on properties described in ancient cookbooks pre-dating modern chemistry to prove the saline connection.\n\nWhether the salt, analyzed and synthesized, actually tastes like the [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] Stellar Salt of old is ultimately of little consequence. Just the idea of traditional foods now possessing more historically accurate flavor profiles is bound to stimulate both the [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] economy and palate."

 country.1100.desc:0 "Our first stumbling steps into the void beyond §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! were not motivated solely by curiosity, or a desire to conquer the unknown, or a need to leave our mark on the galaxy.\n\nThe biosphere of §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! has undergone rapid changes in the past few centuries, and prominent scientists warn that §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! may be faced with the beginnings of a mass extinction event; that cyclical purging of life that is inseparable from planetary existence in the greater cosmos.\n\nA research plan has been put together to study a number of planets rendered uninhabitable by major astronomical incidents or planet-bound catastrophes. We hope that by reconstructing these events, a similar fate may be avoided for §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! and the §Y[Root.GetSpeciesName]§! race.\n\nIt falls to you as [Root.GetRulerTitle] of the §Y[Root.GetName]§! to ensure that this expedition is carried out.\n\nConsult the §HSituation Log§! for details."

 country.1110.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Burned Planet"
 country.1110.desc:0 "One of the planets orbiting this star bears the still-open wounds of some past calamity. Its surface is a roiling sea of half-melted minerals boiling into a superheated atmosphere, but [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] astronomers claim that it may once have supported life.\n\nA Special Project has been issued to study the molten planet."
 country.1115.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Desolate Planet"
 country.1115.desc:0 "A planet in this system still wears the fossilized traces of a past ecology on its sleeve. What could turn a thriving biosphere into a blasted wasteland?\n\nA Special Project has been issued to trace the source of this disastrous transformation."
 country.1120.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Noxious Planet"
 country.1120.desc:0 "Allegedly this planet's flora and fauna choked on their own poisonous emissions, likely helped along by the release of reactive gases from beneath the planet's crust.\n\nA Special Project has been issued to investigate the matter."
 country.1125.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Chilly Planet"
 country.1125.desc:0 "The planet of interest in this system is covered in layer upon layer of dense ices of varying composition. Apparently it was once home to more varied and pleasant biomes.\n\nA Special Project has been issued to investigate this possibility."
 country.1130.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Asteroid"
 country.1130.desc:0 "The asteroid is in actuality a chunk of what was once a habitable, and probably inhabited, planet. Regular but overlapping fracture patterns indicate that the planetary demolition was intentional and controlled, if somewhat rushed.\n\nAll signs point to this planet being the homeworld of whatever species destroyed it. We may never know what drove them to consider planetary annihilation to be the lesser evil, and perhaps we should be grateful for that."
 country.1135.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Molten"
 country.1135.desc:0 "The unfortunate fate of the planet can be laid squarely at the feet of cosmic whims. Some gravitational disturbance (after eyeing the system's sun with some suspicion, our scientists named a transient space-time anomaly as the likely culprit) forced the planet from its natural orbit to one much too close to the sun. Although the planet is slowly spiraling out towards its original orbit, it has been cooking in the residual heat from the star ever since."
 country.1140.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Barren"
 country.1140.desc:0 "Life on the now-barren planet was, sadly, doomed from the start.\n\nAs if by some cruel stellar conspiracy, the dominant species on the planet barely had time to awaken to sapience and invent agriculture before, through unfortunate geological mechanisms, the earth started turning sour.\n\nSamples from lower soil strata and the fossilized remains of the creatures that once roamed the planet show that several vital minerals needed to rejuvenate the soil ended up, through their largely agricultural diet, in the endoskeletons of the native beings. Their bones were prone to fossilize rather than decay, and their very existence exhausted the fragile ecosystem they inhabited, leaving it permanently transformed in the wake of their passing."
 country.1145.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Toxic"
 country.1145.desc:0 "The cracks in the planet's crust, first presumed to be the result of significant tectonic activity, are actually the lasting marks of impossibly large roots, burrowing through the earth.\n\nAt some point in the distant past, a freak mutation - possibly deliberately induced by sentient beings, though it is unlikely they could have predicted the result - caused the native plant life to grow out of control. Many of these plants reproduce through pollination, with countless gametes carried by currents through the lower atmosphere. While this process was originally only cause for mild irritation, the exponential increase in atmosphere-borne particles effectively choked the life out of all animals on the planet in a matter of months."
 country.1150.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Frozen"
 country.1150.desc:0 "An unnatural shift in the atmosphere's chemical make-up resulted in the slow but irreversible onset of an ice age - one that began before the formation of the [Root.Owner.GetName] and is likely to persist long after our passing.\n\nThe exact cause remains unknown, but probable explanations include failed terraforming attempts or even intra-planetary terrorism. Some of the more radical elements within the scientific community on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] suggest that the dramatic climate shift may have been brought on by the unchecked emission of gaseous industrial by-product into the atmosphere.\n\nThis view is confined to the scientific fringe, as it is unlikely that any race intelligent enough to achieve full industrialization would be stupid enough to accidentally wipe themselves out."
 country.1155.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Study Complete"
 country.1155.desc:0 "While the research expedition often yielded unexpected results, [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] scientists now have access to an unprecedented wealth of data with which to accurately model the future of [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nInitial reports suggest that [Root.Capital.GetName] will be in no real danger for at least a dozen generations, save from freak cosmic events or the violent collapse of the [Root.GetName]."

 country.1157.b:0 "Another successful operation by the [Root.GetRulerTitle]."
 country.1158.name:0 "Mass Extinction: Information Dissemination"
 country.1158.desc:0 "The information gleaned by the research expedition is the property of the [Root.GetName] and access to it is restricted; a precaution put in place early on to prevent premature and unfavorable conclusions.\n\nWith the study now complete, there is a strong lobby for releasing all associated data to the wider scientific community."

The obvious drawbacks in this inherently delayed reaction time are somewhat offset by the Amoeba's sheer number of circulating flagella, and the individual flagellum's strong set of reflexive responses and ability to dumbly track the host Amoeba.

 ### Old Civ Drones

 colony.1500.name:0 "A Prelude"
 colony.1500.desc:0 "Something stirs on the moon of [Root.GetName].\n\nPreliminary scans indicate that some ancient technology has become active, possibly as a response to our colonization efforts.\n\nSeveral of our top scientists are eager to take a closer look at the moon, and have prepared a special research project."
 colony.1500.a:0 "Of course they have."
 colony.1501.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Discovery"
 colony.1501.desc:0 "It is a gaggle of wayward drones, of course.\n\nInitial disappointment was swept away by the drones' erroneous IFF classification of us - they think we are a race affiliated with their long-dead masters! They seemed very excited, if old AI constructs can be excited, to see us. Unfortunately, the drones again lapsed into inactivity shortly after and we have been unable to resuscitate them.\n\nOr take them apart, for that matter."
 colony.1501.a:0 "Keep an eye on the situation."
 colony.1502.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Awakening"
 colony.1502.desc:0 "The drones woke from their slumber and descended to the surface of [Root.GetName]. Attempts to communicate were met with polite dismissal as they set about terraforming a small area of the planet. We do not know the nature of whatever ancient directive they are executing, but it does not seem detrimental to the colony."
 colony.1502.a:0 "Well, as long as their activities benefit us..."
 colony.1502.a.tooltip:0 "The drones remove a random £blocker  §YTile Blocker§! from the surface, leaving the planet otherwise untouched.\n"
 colony.1503.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Reaching For Past Skies"
 colony.1503.desc:0 "The old drones fitfully dormant on [Root.GetName]'s moon have become active again, and their work is a mixed blessing.\n\nUnder the cover of night and spotty airspace surveillance, they have erected the framework of some gigantic structure a short distance away from our primary settlement on [Root.GetName]. Our engineers are convinced it is the realization of some outmoded concept known as a "space elevator", perhaps a common sight in the times before we [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] first took to the stars. It will eventually have to be razed as it stands in the way of our expansion plans for the colony, and bringing it down safely will take some time. At least our engineers are giddy with excitement at the prospect of studying the thing up close."
 colony.1503.a:0 "Good for them."
 colony.1504.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Spontaneous Generosity"
 colony.1504.desc:0 "After waking yet again, the drones briefly disappeared from sensors. When they returned, it was with a large cache of minerals of unknown origin in tow. They dumped it on the surface of [Root.GetName] after sending a badly corrupted burst transmission indicating that they had fulfilled a requisition request.\n\nThen they went back to the moon."
 colony.1504.a:0 "Free minerals. No complaints."
 colony.1505.name:0 "Ancient Drones: An Estranged Relative"
 colony.1505.desc:0 "Frantic signal bursts from the moon alerted us to the fact that the old drones on [Root.GetPlanetMoon] have woken yet again. This time they bring us a significant prize, as they have unearthed an ancient satellite from the depths of their moon and partially repaired it. We do not know how the satellite ended up there, nor why the drones have ignored it until now. Regardless, if even a fragment of its databanks have survived, there is a lot we can learn about day-to-day life in the empires that the drones first served."
 colony.1506.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Drone Debacle"
 colony.1506.desc:0 "The erratic behavior of the narcoleptic drones have taken a violent turn. A number of them woke and entered the atmosphere of [Root.GetName], as is their wont, only to slam into the surface of the planet at full thrust.\n\nRepeatedly, in many cases.\n\nDamage to the colony was negligible but the nigh-invulnerable drones were destroyed in bright showers of blue sparks, indicative of the tremendous force of, and dedication to, their self-destruction."
 colony.1506.a:0 "Can we find out what was wrong with them?"
 colony.1507.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Looking For Drones"
 colony.1507.desc:0 "The surviving drones have been missing since the suicide incident. History buffs on [Root.GetName] are convinced the drones are still in close proximity, shielded from prying eyes by some lost technology, but the expected time window for their next activation has come and gone.\n\nProgress on deep analysis of the destroyed drones' remains has been slow, but a breakthrough is expected soon."
 colony.1507.a:0 "Keep me posted."
 colony.1508.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Panning For Gold"
 colony.1508.desc:0 "Sorting out the errant innards of the shattered drones took much longer than anticipated, as each drone seems to have been built from a slightly different design, assembled from slightly different parts. Once this fact was established, one thing stood out - the parts that were identical. Separated from the rest, it is clear these parts are of somewhat modern, if alien, make. It is likely that someone has done what we could not, and tampered with the drones."
 colony.1508.a:0 "This warrants further investigation."
 colony.1509.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Alien to the Aliens"
 colony.1509.desc:0 "Having pieced them together, the foreign objects inside the destroyed drones have been identified by our experts as one-way transmitters. Since they are not set to receive, it is safe to assume that the drones were not acting at the behest of some third party. Rather, some entity has been keeping tabs on the drones' activities. It is advisable to look into this matter, so a special project has been prepared."
 colony.1510.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Schemes Revealed"
 colony.1510.desc:0 "We have found the remaining drones, drifting into orbit around [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. We have learned that they are unwitting pawns in an elaborate scheme set up by an unknown faction.\n\nGoing by the modus operandi of this operation, this faction is most likely a particularly old and particularly clever pirate syndicate. They must have found the drones drifting through space and done what we could not; modified them. While not as impressive as it sounds - all they did was introduce self-contained alien technology into the drones - fact remains that these alien pirates possess a technological know-how far in advance of our own, at least in certain areas. Having installed their comms devices in the drones, the pirates let them drift through space again, knowing that they are set to assist their original masters' colonists and that the drones' ability to accurately identify such colonists has degraded with age. The drones have essentially been fattening up our colony as the pirates watch, waiting for the ideal time to strike.\n\nOur military analysts predict that the pirates will strike within the next two years."
 colony.1510.a:0 "Let them come."
 colony.1510.b:0 "Capture the drones, send them to destroy their would-be masters."
 colony.1510.c:0 "We must not let this happen again. Dismantle the drones."
 colony.1511.name:0 "Ancient Drones: A Final Goodbye"
 colony.1511.desc:0 "We have captured the drones and fitted them with explosive charges. Reprogramming them proved to be a relatively easy task now that we know how to break them open, and we have plotted a course for the estimated location of the pirate fleet. Top [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] scientists have implemented our own IFF technology to minimize the risk of the drones attacking innocents."
 colony.1511.a:0 "Let them fly."
 colony.1512.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Wounded and Volatile"
 colony.1512.desc:0 "The pirate fleet is inbound, earlier than expected. It is likely our preemptive strike was successful both in provoking and damaging them - their fleet is roughly 30% smaller than projected."
 colony.1513.name:0 "Ancient Drones: They're Everywhere"
 colony.1513.desc:0 "The pirate fleet has arrived, somewhat later than expected. Judging by the makeup of the fleet and formations used, they have rallied their allies in an effort to pillage and burn [Root.GetName] as quickly and decisively as possible."
 colony.1513.a:0 "They will do no such thing."
 colony.1514.name:0 "Ancient Drones: Showdown"
 colony.1514.desc:0 "The time has come, and the pirate armada arrives on cue."
 colony.1514.a:0 "This fight has been a long time coming."

### Mharin Kharin Aphrodisiac Pollen

 colony.1520.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Floral Fascination"
 colony.1520.desc:0 "Several plants native to [Root.GetName], where we recently established a colony, exude copious amounts of a pollen with an astounding chemical complexity.\n\nA special research project has been prepared for further study of this flora."
 colony.1521.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Olfactory Arousal"
 colony.1521.desc:0 "Long-term exposure to the pollen naturally occurring in [Root.GetName]'s atmosphere acts on the colonists' pheromone receptors with a mild aphrodisiac effect, accompanied by a barely-perceptible "high". The plant that produces the most potent strain is a flower common to all areas of the planet; squirreled away into some obscure taxonomic nook by scientists on [Root.GetName] but known in the local [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] dialect as "Mharin Kharin"."
 colony.1521.b:0 "We cannot allow mind-altering particles in the atmosphere."
 colony.1521.c:0 "We do not have the resources to exterminate the plant."
 colony.1522.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Making Time for Petals"
 colony.1522.desc:0 "Reports from [Root.GetName] indicate that worker productivity has declined recently, becoming stable at levels several percent lower than the [Root.Owner.GetName] average.\n\nThis may or may not be due to the stimulating effects of the pollen native to the planet.\n\nIt probably is.\n\nA special project has been prepared should we wish to make our production pipelines more efficient to make up for the loss."
 colony.1522.a:0 "Let's see what can be done."
 colony.1523.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Work Over Flowers"
 colony.1523.desc:0 "Far-reaching changes to time management paradigms and the way responsibility is delegated within all fields of production and other duties on [Root.GetName] have produced good results. The populace has an evident desire - outside observers would call it an outright need - to be in close proximity to the native flora.\n\nWith clever scheduling and additional checks in place, productivity remains low but has risen above the lower limit of what can be deemed acceptable."
 colony.1523.a:0 "Good work."
 colony.1524.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Rooted in Place"
 colony.1524.desc:0 "A recent survey indicates that residents of [Root.GetName] are much less likely than other denizens of the [Root.Owner.GetName] to migrate to other planets.\n\nThe survey does not address whether this could be due to a psychological dependency on the low-level sensory arousal caused by Mharin Kharin and its sibling-plants."
 colony.1525.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Transmission Trouble"
 colony.1525.desc:0 "While productivity is no longer declining on the planet, communications between the colony on [Root.GetName] and the capital on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] are breaking down. Senior officials on [Root.GetName] are growing increasingly distant, and our clerks are complaining that even relaying simple directives is becoming an exercise in frustration."
 colony.1525.a:0 "Sigh."
 colony.1525.b:0 "Deploy an administrative task force. Code mauve."
 colony.1526.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Upper Management Betrayal"
 colony.1526.desc:0 "It appears that the crack team of administrators we sent to [Root.GetName] in order to set things straight have been turned. Fortunately for us, their plot to do as little work as possible was, unsurprisingly, sloppily executed and easily discovered. Heads will roll - metaphorically speaking of course - as our last recourse is to depose the local government and manage the colony's affairs from the capital."
 colony.1526.a:0 "It won't be pretty."
 colony.1527.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: With an Iron Fist, From Afar"
 colony.1527.desc:0 "Our remote-government of [Root.GetName] is now firmly established. It has met with some success in suppressing the proliferation of the pollen-bearing plant Mharin Kharin as well as in eroding the community's acceptance of "using" it - no small feat considering the act is as innocent as smelling a flower."
 colony.1528.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Slash and Burn"
 colony.1528.desc:0 "Our remote-governance of [Root.GetName] continues to be a somewhat awkward but effective arrangement. The council in charge has allegedly secured the loyalty of a faction of our armed forces on the planet - apparently they prefer staying indoors to breathing in the Mharin Kharin pollen. The remote-government wishes to use these troops to mount an offensive on the flower, having them erect atmospheric purifiers and wiping the plant from all urban areas entirely."
 colony.1528.a:0 "We should have done this a long time ago."
 colony.1528.a.tooltip:0 "The intoxicating plant is strictly controlled and contained outside of populated areas, removing all related modifiers.\n"
 colony.1529.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Pollen Worship"
 colony.1529.desc:0 "Fringe elements on [Root.GetName] have banded together to form a quasi-religious organization seeking to control all aspects of the Mharin Kharin flower and its cultivation. Their leader, a self-styled "Green Hierophant" of this "Flower Temple" claims to speak for all flora and fauna of [Root.GetName] and demands exclusive trading rights for the plant.\n\nThis is of course completely unacceptable and impossible, as the native flora of [Root.GetName] is of little strategic or economic value and thus may not be brought off-world by law.\n\nUnfortunately, they are unlikely to accept this fact gracefully."
 colony.1530.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Beginning of Pollen's End"
 colony.1530.desc:0 "The Flower Temple and its followers now make up a sizable minority of the population on [Root.GetName], and reports indicate a disturbing change in the movement. Their futile attempts to smuggle Mharin Kharin specimen off-world have been growing less enthusiastic by the day, as the Flower Temple seems to be transitioning into a doomsday cult. There is likely a correlation with the recent changes in the Mharin Kharin pollen's chemical makeup, detected by atmospheric sensors.\n\nA special project has been prepared to assess the risks associated with this, and it is recommended to complete it before something goes horribly wrong."
 colony.1530.a:0 "Very well."
 colony.1531.name:0 "Mharin Kharin: Disaster Averted"
 colony.1531.desc:0 "Quick and decisive action allowed us to identify the risks associated with the rapid changes in the pollen native to [Root.GetName] and take the necessary steps.\n\nThe necessary steps were a complete planetary evacuation and a planet-wide tactical pesticide bombing run, targeting the Mharin Kharin flower and its ilk.\n\nThe plants were rapidly mutating and their unique pollen would, had they not been destroyed, soon have begun delivering a potent neurotoxin to the olfactory organs of all sentient life on [Root.GetName].\n\nThe scientists on the colonization council theorize that this is part of a natural cycle on [Root.GetName] and that the pollen's adverse effects on us, in the form of a crumbling local administration, the rise of the Flower Temple cult, and eventual pollen toxicity, were chance side-effects rather than the product of a plant's sinister self-defense mechanism.\n\nRegardless, any and all traces of the flower have been wiped from the planet's surface, and our colonists are safe and free of the pollen's influence."
