 # Events
 anomaly.2080.name:0 "The Enigmatic Robot"
 anomaly.2580.desc:0 "As our scientists were looking into the earlier civilization on [From.GetName], they came across a small enigmatic robot trying to hide from them. Following weeks of approaching and befriending the little thing, it finally brought them back to a still-functional factory that it has been supervising since the demise of its creators.\n\nAfter being guided to the building, our people were given a large quantity of resources they could bring back to their ship. Though weird and hard to communicate with, the little robot seems to think of our scientists as its friends."

 anomaly.6700.name:0 "Narrow Escape"
 anomaly.6700.desc:0 "As the [Root.GetName]s' crew explored the barren wastes of §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§!, the first reports were much as expected: this is an unnatural wasteland with no signs of life above the water's surface. However, the planet's aquatic life has evolved well past the point we would expect some species to make forays onto dry land.\n\nAdditionally, the crew discovered what originally appeared to be various ancient-looking, sand-covered structures. Shortly after they began digging into these apparent buildings, small swarms of nanites emerged and began harassing the researchers. It seems the buildings are formed not from sand, but by billions of microscopic nanomachines!\n\nOnce mobilized, these swarms quickly multiplied, awakening more and more of the dormant whole. [Root.GetLeaderName] ordered a swift evacuation of the planet, allowing the [Root.GetName] just enough time to escape the atmosphere with a swarming storm of nanites in hot pursuit. The remaining swarm now seems agitated, and it's not calming down."

 anomaly.6705.desc.start:0 "The [root.GetName] has completed its study of the nanites native to §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§!, and the results are incredible. Thousands of years ago, a ship hailing from an advanced civilization crashed here. Aboard that vessel were robots of dozens different designs."

 anomaly.6705.desc.noL:0 "Whoever built these machines was in possession of truly advanced technology, long before our time."
 anomaly.6705.desc.end:0 "\nThe robots operated autonomously and attempted to secure the planet according to their programming. However, without their creators to rein them in, a battle soon broke out amongst the machines.\n\nThe emerging victor of this conflict was a hyper-adaptive, self-replicating nanite system that rapidly evolved to fit the planet's biosphere. This machine made itself the master of the surface world, breaking down anything from local flora to former, robotic rivals.\n\nWe bear witnessed to the aftermath of this great war: a planet not devoid of life, but instead supporting its evolved apex predator."

 anomaly.6710.desc.start:0 "The denizens of §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§! keep impressing. Any probe we send down into the atmosphere is quickly analyzed and taken apart by the swarm, and shortly thereafter the rest of its hive has learned how to best consume our drones as well - even on the far side of the planet. The swarm demonstrates a measurable increase in its understanding of our technology."
 anomaly.6710.desc.normal:0 "Some of our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] argue that this behavior is proof that the swarm is a sapient being - or beings - and might even be considered to be alive.\n\nIt is time to make a decision: do we let them be, destroy them, or else attempt to appropriate these beings for our own gain?"
 anomaly.6710.desc.gestalt:0 "These are the behaviors of a budding hivemind, and if left to its own devices, the nanite swarm may achieve sapience. Do we leave it in this state, or do we destroy it before it become a threat? Could we somehow appropriate this entity for our gain?"

 anomaly.6715.desc:0 "While the nanite swarm of §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§! was impressive as a collective, as individuals they were quite vulnerable. Extracting a few from the planet's atmosphere and using our advanced AI technology, we have managed to reprogram the communication systems of the machines. Then when we reintroduced our reprogrammed nanites into the swarm, the modifications spread across the globe in a flash.\n\nWith control of the network secured, our first order was to reintroduce a stable biosphere onto §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§! - one which is optimized for [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. The planet is now ready and waiting for us, and the nanite swarm is prepared to help with any task our colonists may give it."

 anomaly.6725.name:0 "Underprepared"
 anomaly.6725.desc:0 "Our precautions and special equipment were not enough. Shortly after establishing a colony on §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§!, we lost contact with our teams on the ground. The last communication we received from the settlement showed a sky darkened by small black bodies swarming the outpost."
 anomaly.6725.a:0 "Damn those nanites!"

 anomaly.6740.name:0 "The Color of Science"
 anomaly.6740.desc:0 "The cause of the solar radiation resonance observed around the corona of §Y[From.GetName]§! turned out to be an unusual crystal formation capable of enduring the heat!\n\nHaving brought the crystal aboard, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] were startled to realize that the strange resonance was reproducible. First, they exposed the crystal to the same solar radiation from [From.GetName], producing an identical result to the initially recorded phenomenon. It also seemed to create resonances with all energy waves we sent through it, forming new colors and sounds never before observed by [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!\n\nSuch frequencies could change the way we view the universe. Alternatively, we can develop research applications for a crystalline structure capable of surviving the intense heat of a star."

Sadly as our telescopes got better, we realized that the planet would probably be a tidally locked, frozen hellscape - a theory which we have confirmed today.\n\nThere is hope, however; this world has all the building blocks necessary for a habitable planet. It might just need a slight push..."

 colony.5000.desc:0 "The enigmatic creature on [Root.GetName] has been very welcoming to our colonists after they settled down on the planet. At first many of our settlers were distrustful of the small robot, but it has shown itself to be incredibly helpful and has played a key role in establishing the colony.\n\nFollowing the first years of the colony, the small thing has become something of a pet figure in the first cities on [Root.GetName], and a mascot for the planet as a whole."

 colony.5005.name:0 "The Ancient Factory"
 colony.5005.desc:0 "The factory supervised by the little robot on [Root.GetName] has been instrumental for the colony in its early years. Now that the settlers have had time to get to know their mascot and understand its uncommon mannerisms, they have learnt that the old building it has taken care of for centuries is falling apart and needs more help than the creature can give it on its own.\n\nThough its ancient engineering and machinery are still foreign to us, our engineers think they should be able to fix it, given time."
 colony.5005.a:0 "Let us see if we can help it out then."

 colony.5006.name:0 "Factory Collapse"
 colony.5006.desc:0 "After years of slow decline, the great factory on [Root.GetName] has finally fallen apart. After clearing out all the debris from the old building, our colonists came across large piles of metal hidden away in what would have been the basement when it was still standing. In the middle of it all lies the robot that once so happily welcomed our settlers to the planet, crushed by the factory it was responsible for supervising."
 colony.5006.a:0 "A mascot no more, then."

 colony.5010.name:0 "The Factory Restored"
 colony.5010.desc:0 "Our engineers were certain they had failed at fixing the ancient factory on [Root.GetName], according to their report, when everything suddenly stopped. Unsure how they had managed to fail they began putting aside their tools and exiting the building, when suddenly the engine roared to life.\n\nNot only is the engine working again, but our engineers seem to have accidentally managed to fix other parts of the factory as well - though it is unclear how that happened. Their report ends with a small description of the weird dance the little robot did when it saw its factory working again."

 colony.5015.desc:0 "We have received a report from the people of [Root.GetName], as it seems once again they are having trouble with the enigmatic robot on their planet. Recently it has gone missing, and its disappearance coincides with the reports of several colonists vanishing from one of the cities on the planet.\n\nThough they were originally assumed to be unrelated, people have started blaming the creature for their missing friends and family. Our engineers are looking into scanning several signals that the robot's factory has received since the incident, to see if it leads back to the creature itself."
 colony.5015.a:0 "Let us hope we can solve this as quickly as possible."

 colony.5020.name:0 "The Remains"
 colony.5020.desc:0 "After spending weeks trying to track down the signals from the robot on [Root.GetName], our engineers have finally found an ancient shaft leading deep into the ground. Far below ground they came across an ancient structure with most of the missing people locked in some form of stasis, as well as the remains of the little robot.\n\nAfter waking the colonists, we learn that all of them are part of some cult that managed to accidentally make their way into the ruins, and that everything was about to collapse on them when the little robot came to their rescue. It seems unclear to both our engineers and the people themselves exactly how they found themselves in a stasis, or what the creature did to stop the collapse of the building.\n\nOur engineers are interested in looking into the enigmatic machine now that it is no longer functional, to see what we can learn from it. The people of [Root.GetName], on the other hand, are pleading with us to see if we can restore the little creature back to its former self."
 colony.5020.a:0 "Let the people have their little mascot back, then."

 ancrel.11000.name:0 "The First Layer"
 ancrel.11000.desc:0 "The ruins seem to be centuries, if not millennia, old. At first it seems to be only a large open-air dome, but as we are excavating the outermost parts we quickly find ourselves in what appears to be the derelict slums of a city. As a large gate blocks our progress deeper into the city, our scientists speculate that it is split into a hierarchy, each layer holding one class of the people of the city.\n\nIt does not take long before one of our scientists finds alien remains in subterranean ruins under the broken concrete floor. After the first corpse is found, however, we start finding remains all over the slums, be it in the streets, in what would have been their homes, or hanging from the most remote parts of the ceiling. It is unclear what killed them, but it is a grisly sight."

 ancrel.11005.name:0 "The Second Layer"
 ancrel.11005.desc:0 "Whereas the first circle seemingly consisted of the ramshackle dwellings of the outcast and destitute, this second circle has more in common with the [Root.GetAdj] notion of proper urban planning.\n\nWe find several open squares our scientists assume used to be marketplaces, though anything from back then has long since decayed to the point where it is impossible to make out what it might have been.\n\nIt does not take long before we start finding unusual remains in this part of the dome too. They seem to have perished in much the same way as their poorer neighbors, and we find the dead strewn all over."

 ancrel.11010.name:0 "The Third Layer"
 ancrel.11010.desc:0 "When the gate into the third layer finally opens, our scientists - curious about what they will find next - flood into what is soon identified as a yet wealthier region of the old dome. At this point we can make confident assumptions about what to expect from this city.\n\nShortly after we enter the layer, one of our people suddenly turns around and savagely attacks a colleague. The victim is already dead on the ground by the time the unexpected assailant is restrained. In the aftermath we are completely unable to get anything sensible out of the crazed scientist, and get no better understanding of what happened to them.\n\nThis layer is significantly smaller than either of the previous two, and it is most likely the final one before we reach the center of the dome. Only one gate remains."

 ancrel.11015.name:0 "The Final Layer"
 ancrel.11015.desc:0 "As soon as the final gate opens up, waves of intense psionic energy wash upon our scientists. Most of them collapse in apparent agony, leaving only a few to make their way into the actual layer itself.\n\nIt seems to be a large temple, with a massive dais or altar in the middle of it. All across the walls there are huge diagrams of different star systems, and a repeated one seems to center on [Root.System.GetName] itself.\n\nMaking their way closer to the middle, the few scientists that remain find that it is in fact an imposing machine fashioned in the form of an old altar."

 colony.9000.desc:0 "Our colony on [Root.GetName] has encountered an odd situation: we have apparently settled on the back of a gargantuan amphibian reptile, whose bony shell is formed of various exotic minerals. Most of what we thought were local islands have turned out to be these creatures; our colonists have begun to refer to them as '§YNemmas§!'.\n\nThey seem harmless enough, and as long as we don't dig too deep into their shell, they should barely notice us."

 colony.9005.name:0 "A Daring Discovery"
 colony.9005.desc:0 "As our colony at [Root.GetName] has been flourishing, the adolescents of this new world have sought to create entertainment for themselves - as youths are wont to do. Some groups have made a game of sneaking up as close as they dare to their local Nemma's head.\n\nUnfortunately, this daring activity has led to tragedy: after startling the beast, several young [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] fell off the neck of the massive creature, resulting in injuries and one fatality.\n\nDistraught colonists are now asking for something to be done about these "brutish behemoths.""
 colony.9005.desc.gestalt:0 "While our [Root.GetName] colony has been flourishing, it has become apparent that Nemmas have a strong aversion to our drones venturing near their head. This became starkly apparent when one such beast flinched and dislodged several [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] from its neck, causing severe damage.\n\nOur progress will be restrained unless we do something to handle these behemoths."

 colony.9015.desc:0 "After initial trials with the adult specimen, our zoologists have set up a Nemma breeding system on [Root.GetName] in the hopes of introducing more giant Nemmas to our oceans. The breeders warn that this cannot continue indefinitely, and that the planet can only support three, perhaps four more Nemmas.

 anomaly.6755.name:0 "Fungal Emitters"
 anomaly.6755.desc:0 "Below the surface of [From.GetName] lives a most peculiar organism. Scans and samples show that it is some sort of mycelium littered with spores. Compared to the traditional size of spores on our homeworld, these are massive. Their surface is a shimmering kaleidoscope, and the hues seem to change based on their surroundings.\n\nThe strangest thing about them is that they seem to form a network capable of generating what the science crew believes could be a signal. The current emissions are very weak, but with some effort, it might be possible to find out where they lead."
 anomaly.6755.a:0 "We will try to identify the signal destination."
 anomaly.6755.b:0 "Bring them back to be sold."
 anomaly.6755.c:0 "We don't have time for this."
 anomaly.6760.intro:0 "Below the surface of [From.GetName] lives a familiar organism. Scans and samples show that it is some sort of mycelium, littered with enormous spores and directly related to the 'Fumongus.' Its spores seem, however, to have mutated and grown into small beads. Their everchanging colorful surface is quite the spectacle, but more importantly, they seem to be producing a stronger signal than the regular spores."
 anomaly.6760.desc:0 "$anomaly.6760.intro$\n\nOur scientists hypothesize that we might be capable of strengthening the current network by bringing some of these spores back to the 'Fumongus'."

 anomaly.6785.desc:0 "Grafting the mutated spores onto the existing mushroom was a feat of bioengineering. With the help of archives detailing the genetic alterations already made on the 'Fumongus,' our scientists managed to further alter it without compromising its efficiency. The results were spectacular, and in a matter of months, the mushrooms had grown tenfold. This in turn increased the need for water to supply them, but the nearby frozen asteroids hold enough to hydrate them for centuries, if not millennia.\n\nWith bigger mushrooms came a better network, and after some upgrades to the computing equipment, we are now once again ready to listen to what the spores have to say."

 ### Fumongus Colony Events
 #Events

 colony.2060.name:0 "Mushroom Picking"
 colony.2060.desc:0 "A routine ecological study of our colony on [Root.GetName] has stumbled upon a strange fungal lifeform. The science team reports that the surface of the mycelium is shimmering and colorful, but what was most intriguing to them was the fact that separate clusters were seemingly communicating with one another whenever something occurred within a wide radius.\n\nFurthermore, the biology of the organism appears to be clearly alien to the ecosystem of the colony. Puzzled, the local science team has requested specialized support as we might be dealing with a sentient species."
 colony.2060.a:0 "Dispose of them."
 colony.2060.b:0 "Take a closer look"
 colony.2060.c:0 "... They are related to the Fumongus!"
 colony.2065.name:0 "The Spores Have Ears"
 colony.2065.desc:0 "We have concerning reports coming from [Root.GetName]. Upon further examination, it seems that the alien fungus we found is emitting a signal towards a location in the galaxy that we were unable to pinpoint so far. Telemetry and security analysis indicate that it is completely possible for the mycelium to be some kind of advanced spying organism.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that this organism is old. There is a fair chance that whomever engineered these spying mushrooms is not around anymore. But if they are, it might be best not to poke the sleeping predator."
 colony.2065.a:0 "We need to know more."
 colony.2065.b:0 "This is too risky. Destroy them."
 colony.2070.intro:0 "Careful analysis of the mycelium and the signals showed that it was likely part of a network of similar organisms, possibly spanning across the galaxy as a whole, and maybe beyond. While we do not know much, we discovered that as part of the network, this mycelium was also receiving signals from other places."
 colony.2070.name:0 "Someone is Listening"
 colony.2070.desc:0 "$colony.2070.intro$\n\nWe cannot be certain, but considering several factors, including the volume of data transferred, we believe that someone is actively using the network and collecting information from it. We are already working on a counter-intelligence plan of disinformation, and security measures are being updated empire wide to account for this form of spycraft."
 colony.2070.a:0 "Let the disinformation begin!"
 colony.2075.name:0 "No One Listens"
 colony.2075.desc:0 "$colony.2070.intro$\n\nConsidering several factors, including the volume of data transferred, we do not think that the network is still in use. The fact that it is still partially active indicates that it is probably just dormant and not destroyed."
 colony.2075.a:0 "What can we learn from it?"
 colony.2080.name:0 "Spore Connection"
 colony.2080.desc:0 "Whatever doubts we had about this fungus' connection to the mycelial listening array were quickly dispelled after a brief comparison. This is one of the many offsprings communicating with the Fumongus, and this could be an opportunity to further our comprehension of the organism."
 colony.2080.a:0 "See if we can strengthen the network."
 colony.2080.b:0 "Use it to keep a closer eye on the colony."
 colony.2080.c:0 "We dismantled the network, but we can still study it."
 colony.2085.name:0 "Unrest on [Root.GetName]"
 colony.2085.desc:0 "Word about our project to use the local mycelium to closely monitor the colony has spread, and it wasn't well received. Despite our best efforts to defuse the situation, the local population widely considers this as a breach of trust and are demanding that we put an end to this project immediately.\n\nThe situation is escalating quickly, and our local enforcers are overwhelmed. They would need help to maintain control of the colony if we choose to go on with the project."
 colony.2085.a:0 "The population is right. Abort."
 colony.2085.b:0 "If they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear."
 colony.2090.name:0 "The Spores Are Our Ears"
 colony.2090.desc:0 "We have grown the mycelium on [Root.GetName], and fine-tuned the local computing equipment to sort through the interference. The responsible team reports that the network is now closely monitoring the colonists. Already, a number of petty criminals have been sanctioned appropriately.\n\nUnfortunately, attempts at replicating the installation in other places have met with failure. It is likely that some unknown factor is at play here."
 colony.2095.name:0 "Fungal Failure"
 colony.2095.desc:0 "Our efforts to stimulate the spread of the mycelium on [Root.GetName] have resulted in the growth of more 'traditional' mushrooms. An incident with some colonists has shown them to be edible. This event has thrown the whole network off balance for a while, but it now appears to be stabilized and functional. However, no significant improvement has been noticed overall. It looks like these mushrooms are merely storage for water. They do not contribute to the network and their destruction has no impact on it either."
 colony.2095.a:0 "Harvest them."
 colony.2095.b:0 "Study them. "
