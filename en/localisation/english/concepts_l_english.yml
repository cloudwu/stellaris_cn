### CONCEPTS
#
# Above each concept definition are instructions on usage, including an icon where one exists.
#   Note that between the icon and the term there's a non-breaking space. When you copy the usage example, it will keep the non-breaking space.
#   This is important to not get a line break between the icon and the concept.
# Use a concept link with icon the first time a new concept is mentioned, then use §H without an icon for repeated uses.
# Use §H with an icon the first time a concept is used withing its own description.
# Use §H without an icon if the concept is used more than once.
