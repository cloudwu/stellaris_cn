ADD SNEK_SCIENCE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Science! We're using science! After a series of careful observations and productive meetings, we intended to find patterns in the ophidians' behaviors and methodically adopt plans to counter them. If we can find evidence of tool use and adaptive strategy, we may even be able to reason with them! We just need to make sure not to corrupt the data by interfering with their activities, even when they're biting colonists and siphoning power."

It's time to post some sentries, set up some patrols, and work our way through from home to home with ophidian incenerators. Burn them out! No matter what the cost, we've got to stand and deliver against anything that slithers."
