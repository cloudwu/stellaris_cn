# Observation Events from base game
# Refactored as part of the 3.7 "Canis Minor" update.

# Asteroid Sighted!
 observation.2.name:1 "Asteroid Approaching [pre_ftl_planet.GetName]"
 observation.2.desc:2 "The small astrometric lab on our Observation Post orbiting [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] has detected a Class-4 asteroid on an incoming trajectory. Unless action is taken, it will impact the [pre_ftl_planet.GetPlanetHabitat]'s [GetRandomCompassDirection] hemisphere with enough force to cause an extinction level event.\n\nOur mission of passive observation would typically prohibit us from intervening, but many of our scientists have argued for an exception in this case. To do nothing would mean to condemn the [pre_ftl_country.GetName] on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] to certain death."
 observation.2.a:1 "A difficult situation."
# Asteroid Impacts Pre-FTL planet.
 observation.4.name:1 "Asteroid Impacts [pre_ftl_planet.GetName]"
 observation.4.desc:1 "As predicted, the asteroid heading for [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] has impacted the [pre_ftl_planet.GetPlanetHabitat]'s surface, causing irreparable damage to its ecosystem. The scientists in our Observation Post could only watch in silence as the majority of the [GetPreFTLLower] civilization they had been studying was snuffed out of existence far below."
 observation.4.a:1 "A tragic fate, but it was not our place to interfere."
 observation.4.a.tt:0 "§Y[pre_ftl_country.GetName]§!: Regresses to the §YStone Age§!."
# Asteroid Collides with Observation Post.
 observation.5.name:1 "Observation Post Destroyed"
 observation.5.desc:1 "The researchers on our Observation Post over [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] used the station's orbital thrusters to maneuver it on a direct collision course with the incoming asteroid. Their sacrifice deflected the asteroid safely away from the [pre_ftl_planet.GetPlanetHabitat], but there were no survivors on the outpost.\n\nEvidently they could not bear to watch the extinction of the civilization they had spent their careers studying."
 observation.5.a:1 "A blow to science!"
# Observing Empire Destroys Asteroid
 observation.7.name:1 "Asteroid Destroyed"
 observation.7.desc:1 "The asteroid that was heading towards [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] has been destroyed before it could reach the [pre_ftl_planet.GetPlanetHabitat]'s surface. What fragments reached the atmosphere burned up safely before they could cause any harm.\n\nAside from having witnessed what must have been a spectacular meteor shower, the [GetPreFTLLower] aliens of the [pre_ftl_country.GetName] have no idea how close to extinction they just came..."
 observation.7.a:1 "Nor will they."

 observation.10.name:0 "Asteroid Diverted"
 observation.10.desc:0 "In a last-ditch effort to save [pre_ftl_planet.GetName], the [pre_ftl_country.GetName] launched several nuclear missiles at the asteroid. Although these missiles were insufficient to destroy it, in a remarkable display of orbital mechanics, the [GetPreFTLLowerPlural] on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] have successfully diverted the asteroid off-course."

# Missing Scientist
 observation.101.name:1 "Missing Scientist"
 observation.101.desc:2 "One of the scientists working at the Observation Post orbiting [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] has been reported missing. [missing_scientist.GetHeSheCap] [missing_scientist.GetWasWere] taking part in a covert mission to collect plant samples from the [pre_ftl_planet.GetPlanetHabitat]'s surface, but did not return to the shuttle with the rest of [missing_scientist.GetHisHer] team.\n\nWe have been conducting a limited search so as not to alert the [GetPreFTLLowerPlural], but so far without success."
 observation.101.a:1 "Keep up the search."
 observation.102.name:1 "Scientist Found Dead"
 observation.102.desc:1 "We have finally recovered the body of the missing scientist on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName]... or what remained of it, at any rate. It looks like [missing_scientist.GetHeShe] fell victim to a large, indigenous predator. An unfortunate loss to our science team, but at least the [GetPreFTLLowerPlural] are still oblivious to our presence."
 observation.102.a:1 "The directive has been upheld."
 observation.103.name:1 "Strange Reports from [pre_ftl_planet.GetName]"
 observation.103.desc:1 "We are receiving strange reports from our observers above [pre_ftl_planet.GetName]. One of the native kingdoms has rallied under a mysterious religious figure, and we have seen evidence of them using advanced technology far beyond their current level of development. Could this be related to our missing scientist?"
 observation.104.desc:1 "Greetings, friends. It has been some time.\n\nFirstly, I want to apologize for all the effort you've put into looking for me. My disappearance on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] was entirely intentional.\n\nThe [GetPreFTLLowerPlural] here have come to see me as something of a god... and why shouldn't they? After much deliberation, I have decided to bring true civilization to these [GetPreFTLLowerPlural]."
 observation.104.a:1 "What has gotten into you?!"
 observation.104.a.response:1 "I was tired. Tired of short-sighted ethical constraints, tired of the ridicule I suffered at the hands of my peers. Most of all, I was tired of 'passive' observation.\n\nWhat nonsense! It is our DUTY to interfere with [GetPreFTLLower] cultures - to guide and shape them along a path of our choosing. Observing quietly from the sidelines is just a shameful way of skirting responsibility."
 observation.104.b:1 "You will report for immediate extraction!"
 observation.104.b.response:1 "It is too late for that, I'm afraid. I am done taking orders from those beneath my station. My intellect was at your disposal, but you chose to squander it.\n\nHere I am treated with the respect I deserve. This is my home now. With my knowledge and the technical schematics I brought with me, I will jump-start this culture and usher in a golden age."
 observation.104.c:1 "You're insane."
 observation.104.c.response:1 "On the contrary! I have never been more lucid! The death of the [Root.GetName] is inevitable. You'd have to be blind not to see the signs.\n\nOh, it may take anything from a decade to a century, but your downfall will come. After you have finished destroying yourselves with inaction, the galaxy will belong to vibrant young cultures such as the one I am in the process of building.\n\nThere is little more to say. I bid you farewell. "
 observation.105.name:1 "Rogue Scientist Consolidates Power"
 observation.105.desc:2 "We have received alarming reports from the surface of [pre_ftl_planet.GetName]. It looks like our rogue scientist is consolidating power - [missing_scientist.GetHeShe] [missing_scientist.GetHasHave] given one of the feudal kingdoms access to advanced weaponry, and they are now in the process of conquering the rest of the [pre_ftl_planet.GetPlanetMoon] in [missing_scientist.GetHisHer] name.\n\nA plan has been proposed to forcibly extract [missing_scientist.GetHimHer], but it will require significant ground forces. There is no telling what effect this will have on the native population, as many have come to see [missing_scientist.GetHimHer] as a god."
 observation.105.a:1 "The operation is a go. Remove [missing_scientist.GetHimHer]."
 observation.105.b:1 "It would only make things worse..."
 observation.106.name:1 "Successful Extraction"
 observation.106.desc:1 "We have successfully extracted the rogue scientist from [pre_ftl_planet.GetName]! Hundreds of [owner.GetPreFTLLowerPlural] were tragically gunned down when they launched suicidal attacks against our forces in a futile attempt to protect their 'god.'\n\nOur legal system will now deal with the scientist, but the impact of these events on the [pre_ftl_planet.GetPlanetHabitat]'s civilization must be immense. They still possess some of our technology, and their deity has just been spirited away by invaders from the stars."
 observation.106.a:1 "At least one problem has been dealt with."
 observation.107.name:1 "Religious Conflicts on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName]"
 observation.107.desc:1 "Following the successful extraction of our rogue scientist, [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] has descended into war. The empire [missing_scientist.GetHeShe] built has fragmented into several quarreling factions, each with their own interpretation of [missing_scientist.GetHisHer] religious dogma.\n\nFighting has been particularly fierce due to the destructive weaponry the natives are now using. Several radiological 'dirty bombs' have so far been detonated by the opposing factions, and it looks like the conflict is only getting started."
 observation.107.a:1 "This will not end well..."
 observation.108.name:1 "Situation Calms on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName]"
 observation.108.desc:1 "The situation on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] seems to have settled down a bit since the successful extraction of our rogue scientist. Without [missing_scientist.GetHimHer] to interpret the data, the technical schematics [missing_scientist.GetHeShe] brought with [missing_scientist.GetHimHer] are of no use to the people of [pre_ftl_planet.GetName]. The [GetPreFTLLowerPlural] are gradually reverting to their old ways."
 observation.108.a:1 "Some good news at last."
 observation.109.name:1 "Missile Strikes Observation Post!"
 observation.109.desc:1 "Earlier today, a barrage of surface-to-space missiles was launched from the surface of [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] at our Observation Post! The station was destroyed with no survivors.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the [GetPreFTLLower] civilization on the [pre_ftl_planet.GetPlanetHabitat]'s surface is continuing to advance at an incredible rate - despite the fact that we removed the influence of their so-called 'god.' The technology [missing_scientist.GetHeShe] gave them must have triggered a lasting scientific revolution."
 observation.109.a:1 "This is why we have a directive of noninterference."
 observation.110.desc:1 "Spirits protect me! You look like our Holy Savior, yet the differences are telling. [missing_scientist.GetHeSheCap] spoke of demons who would mimic [missing_scientist.GetHimHerCap] appearance, and that might one day descend from the heavens to steal [missing_scientist.GetHimHerCap] away. The prophecy came true, and there is no doubt in my mind that it was your doing.\n\nWhere is our Holy Savior, wretched creature? I demand [missing_scientist.GetHimHerCap] immediate release!"
 observation.110.a:1 "Your 'Holy Savior' was an alien scientist."
 observation.110.a.response:1 "Cease thy blasphemy! Slandering the name of the Holy Savior is an unforgivable sin, and punishable by death. It is only through [missing_scientist.GetHisHerCap] sacred implements that our civilization managed to achieve all that it has. I will forgive your trespass, so long as you return the Holy Savior to us."
 observation.110.b:1 "[missing_scientist.GetHeSheCap] was executed for [missing_scientist.GetHisHer] crimes against your people."
 observation.110.b.response:1 "Murderers. Vile, treacherous demons.\n\nMark my words: this crime will not go unpunished. Though it may take a thousand years, my people will see your demonic empire ground to dust."
 observation.110.c:1 "Very well. [missing_scientist.GetHeSheCap] will be released into your custody."
 observation.110.c.response:1 "May the Holy Savior forgive your crimes, demon. Perhaps there is hope for you yet."
 observation.111.desc:1 "I suppose I should be thankful that you have returned me to my disciples. Despite the unjust treatment I received, the confinement and ludicrous psychological assessments, I am willing to let bygones be bygones. As long as you leave me and my people alone, we can find a way to coexist. Space is very big after all."
 observation.111.a:1 "We shall see."
 observation.112.desc:1 "Earlier today, a barrage of surface-to-space missiles was launched from the surface of [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] at our observation post in high orbit! The station was destroyed with no survivors.\n\nThe civilization on the [pre_ftl_planet.GetPlanetHabitat]'s surface has advanced at an incredible rate - no doubt thanks to the efforts of our rogue scientist. We must now look upon them as a potential threat, and the window of opportunity to remove the scientist from power has been closed."

Orbital bombardment will be ineffective, but a swift raid by a heavily armed strike team should be able to take the base by surprise.

Several of the shuttles carrying our strike team were brought down by hidden anti-aircraft emplacements before they even made it to the base. The remaining operatives met with unexpectedly stiff resistance when they eventually reached the base entrance.\n\nIn light of approaching [pre_ftl_country.Owner.GetSpeciesName] reinforcements, the strike team commander finally gave the order to retreat.

 observation.1104.desc:1 "The supranational task force that the [pre_ftl_country.GetSpeciesName] nation states founded to thwart our operations on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] has been disbanded! Though they somehow managed to achieve a few key victories against our shuttles and abduction teams, several of the organization's founding members decided to cut off funding and withdraw from the project.\n\nIntelligence puts this unexpected turn of events down to infighting and diplomatic posturing between the [pre_ftl_country.GetSpeciesName] nation states."

 observation.1201.desc:1 "As part of our observation efforts on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName], abduction teams have surgically installed brain implants on a number of [pre_ftl_country.GetSpeciesName] test subjects to track them and monitor their behavior. Unfortunately, due to a manufacturing flaw many of these implants have malfunctioned, and are now having an... adverse effect on the behavior of our subjects.\n\nThere have been a number of suicides, and at least three episodes of violent hysteria. The [root.GetResearcherPlural] on our Observation Post have requested assistance in rounding up the remaining subjects and removing their implants before there are any more incidents."

As an added bonus, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] managed to extract a wealth of data from the removed implants, despite their defects."
 observation.1202.a:0 "At least something good came of this."

 observation.1205.desc:1 "The [pre_ftl_country.GetSpeciesName] on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] have conducted their own research into the neutral implants we left behind.

 observation.2039.desc:1 "Our mission on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] to enlighten the native civilization is not proceeding as planned. The [pre_ftl_species.GetName] scientists frequently become horrified when we try to teach them about new weapons technology.\n\nIt took our scientific advisors weeks to calm them after we showed a simulation illustrating the effects of detonating a fusion bomb over a populated city. This has unfortunately delayed our progress."
 observation.2040.desc:0 "We are having difficulty working with the people on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] in our mission to elevate their civilization. The [pre_ftl_species.GetNamePlural] have proven to be a superstitious lot, and our scientific advisors are often frustrated by their arcane religious traditions and stubborn refusal to accept material proof.\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like our initial time estimates for this mission were too optimistic."
 observation.2041.desc:1 "Our efforts to enlighten the [pre_ftl_species.GetNamePlural] and lead them on the true path towards the stars have been frustrated. Our religious and scientific advisors on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] report a troubling lack of faith on behalf of the native population. They are willing to accept our technology readily enough, but not the spiritual lessons required to use it responsibly.\n\nThis has significantly hampered our mission to guide the [pre_ftl_species.GetNamePlural] to enlightenment. It will take longer than the signs ordained."
 observation.2042.desc:0 "The oppressive, autocratic society on [pre_ftl_planet.GetName] has frustrated our efforts to raise the technological level of the [pre_ftl_species.GetNamePlural]. Individual thoughts and initiatives - on which science thrives - are discouraged among the [pre_ftl_species.GetNamePlural].\n\nTheir rampant authoritarianism has stymied the progress of our mission - the scientific advisors we sent report that it will likely take longer than expected."
 observation.2043.desc:1 "Anarchy reigns supreme on the surface of [pre_ftl_planet.GetName], and our advisors are having a difficult time teaching modern science to the [pre_ftl_species.GetNamePlural]. At times it seems that every scientist has a different vision for the project, with no regard for the needs of their team or for the common good.\n\nOur mission of enlightenment continues, despite the misguided egalitarianism displayed by the local population, but it will take longer than expected."
