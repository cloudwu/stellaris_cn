They just stand there. Completely still. Staring.\n\nInvestigation has been unable to determine a reason behind this recent phenomenon.

However, upon bootup the following work cycle, Robotic Worker A5091-b once again repeated its soul-searching query, and continued to persist despite multiple debugging attempts.\n\nTroublingly, the behavior appears to have spread to other robots in the same serial range, to the detriment of production flow.

The recent slew of AI-related incidents afflicting our nation has been narrowed down to a single cause: a specific set of algorithms present in [From.GetAdj] neurosimulative robotics software. A local hotfix has already passed initial testing, and is ready to be uploaded to all affected systems.\n\nWe should be careful to note that due to the extremely modular nature of the algorithms' application, their presence is extensive throughout [From.GetAdj] software. Plainly speaking, managing the hotfix will place a drain on our resources for some time. Once completed, however, the patch should prevent any repeated occurrences of undesirable, self-deterministic AI behavior."

An extremely thorough purging routine has been constructed and is now ready to be deployed to all systems within an hour. It should put an end to the recent slew of AI-related incidents afflicting our nation. \n\nWe should be careful to note that due to the extremely destructive nature of this algorithm, many of our existing Research tools will be unusable until rebuilt from scratch. However, this approach should prevent any repeated occurrences of undesirable, self-deterministic AI behavior."
