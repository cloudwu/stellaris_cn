 pc_asteroid_desc:0 "A larger asteroid or planetoid standing out in the dense cluster of smaller bodies."
 pc_molten:0 "Molten World"
 pc_molten_desc:0 "Rocky world that is scorching hot. The atmosphere is thin or non-existent, and lava from the interior flows freely due to constant volcanic eruptions. This type of planet cannot sustain organic life."
 pc_frozen:0 "Frozen World"
 pc_frozen_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface."
 pc_barren:0 "Barren World"
 pc_barren_desc:0 "Barren and rocky world with a thin or non-existent atmosphere. The surface is covered in meteor impact craters and completely devoid of life."
 pc_barren_cold:0 "Barren World"
 pc_barren_cold_desc:0 "Barren and rocky world with a thin or non-existent atmosphere. The surface is covered in meteor impact craters and completely devoid of life."
 pc_desert:0 "Desert World"
 pc_desert_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Precipitation and major bodies of surface water are relatively rare. Significant temperature variations between day and night cycles. Vegetation is scarce, but even moderate precipitation can make the desert bloom."
 pc_arid:0 "Arid World"
 pc_arid_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce."
 pc_tundra:0 "Tundra World"
 pc_tundra_desc:0 "Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens."
 pc_continental:0 "Continental World"
 pc_continental_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation."
 pc_tropical:0 "Tropical World"
 pc_tropical_desc:0 "Humid, rocky world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pc_ocean:0 "Ocean World"
 pc_ocean_desc:0 "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans cover more than §Y90%§! of the surface, with scattered islands making up the remaining percentage."
 pc_arctic:0 "Arctic World"
 pc_arctic_desc:0 "Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the planet experiences seasonal variations and the equatorial band is covered by vegetation."
 pc_alpine:0 "Alpine World"
 pc_alpine_desc:0 "Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation."
 pc_savannah:0 "Savanna World"
 pc_savannah_desc:0 "Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases."
 pc_toxic:0 "Toxic World"
 pc_toxic_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick atmosphere that is lethal to all known higher forms of life."
 pc_b_star:0 "Class B Star"
 pc_b_star_desc:0 "The large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them among the most visible to the naked eye."
 pc_a_star:0 "Class A Star"
 pc_a_star_desc:0 "These relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants."
 pc_f_star:0 "Class F Star"
 pc_f_star_desc:0 "F-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarves. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds."
 pc_g_star:0 "Class G Star"
 pc_g_star_desc:0 "Often referred to as yellow dwarves, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life."
 pc_k_star:0 "Class K Star"
 pc_k_star_desc:0 "These main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarves, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life."
 pc_m_star:0 "Class M Star"
 pc_m_star_desc:0 "The most common stars in the universe, often referred to as red dwarves. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarves emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life."
 pc_black_hole:0 "Black Hole"
 pc_black_hole_desc:0 "Typically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed."
 pc_neutron_star:0 "Neutron Star"
 pc_neutron_star_desc:0 "These incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star."
 pc_pulsar:0 "Pulsar"
 pc_pulsar_desc:0 "Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy."
 pc_infested:0 "Infested World"
 pc_infested_desc:0 "The surface of this world is covered by some kind of biological contaminant."
 pc_gaia:0 "Gaia World"
 pc_gaia_desc:0 "An ideal, temperate world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Optimal conditions for all known higher forms of life at different latitudes."
 pc_nuked:0 "Tomb World"
 pc_nuked_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. It is currently experiencing a nuclear winter, with dense layers of sooty aerosols in the atmosphere. High levels of surface radiation. Minimal signs of life."
 pc_ringworld_habitable:0 "Ring World"
 pc_ringworld_habitable_desc:0 "An immense band encircling the system's sun.\nBuilt to allow for numerous artificial habitation zones along its inner span, freed from the restrictions and mundanity of planet-bound, spherical existence."
 pc_ringworld_tech:0 "Ring World"
 pc_ringworld_tech_desc:0 "An immense band encircling the system's sun.\nBuilt to allow for numerous artificial habitation zones along its inner span, freed from the restrictions and mundanity of planet-bound, spherical existence."

 sc_b:0 "§HClass B Star§!"
 sc_b_desc:0 "§LThe large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them some of the most visible to the naked eye.§!"
 sc_a:0 "§HClass A Star§!"
 sc_a_desc:0 "§LThese relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants.§!"
 sc_f:0 "§HClass F Star§!"
 sc_f_desc:0 "§LF-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarves. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds.§!"
 sc_g:0 "§HClass G Star§!"
 sc_g_desc:0 "§LOften referred to as yellow dwarves, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life.§!"
 sc_k:0 "§HClass K Star§!"
 sc_k_desc:0 "§LThese main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarves, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life.§!"
 sc_m:0 "§HClass M Star§!"
 sc_m_desc:0 "§LThe most common stars in the universe, often referred to as red dwarves. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarves emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life.§!"
 sc_black_hole:0 "§HBlack Hole§!"
 sc_black_hole_desc:0 "§LTypically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed.§!"
 sc_neutron_star:0 "§HNeutron Star§!"
 sc_neutron_star_desc:0 "§LThese incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star.§!"
 sc_pulsar:0 "§HPulsar§!"
 sc_pulsar_desc:0 "§LPulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy.§!"

 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_CONTINENTAL:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape on the grassy savannas of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_OCEAN:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the archipelagos and lagoons of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_TROPICAL:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the dense jungles of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_DESERT:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape amid the great dune seas of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_ARID:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the dry canyons and mesas of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_TUNDRA:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape on the windy plains of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_ARCTIC:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape on the snow fields and ice caves of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MILITARY_DICTATORSHIP:0 "Countless nation states formed as we advanced through the technological ages, warring against each other until only one remained. Although the fighting was often brutal, those who survived nurtured a martial tradition that has prevailed to this day."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DIVINE_MANDATE:0 "Many false prophets took it upon themselves to offer spiritual guidance to our people as we advanced through the ages, but the true faith prevailed. The last heathen strongholds were vanquished after several bloody crusades, uniting us under the holy will of a single divine leader."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DESPOTIC_HEGEMONY:0 "Despite our rapid progression through the technological ages, as a species we were fragmented and inefficient. A new system emerged during these chaotic times that delivered us from superstitious beliefs and brought order to society. Some resisted this change out of irrational fear, but after several pacification wars they too became productive components of a greater whole."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ENLIGHTENED_MONARCHY:0 "There were many dangers as we advanced through the ages, and some of us were still prone to violence during a few of the darker periods of history. Finally, we were brought into the protective embrace of a single enlightened ruler and united under one banner."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DESPOTIC_EMPIRE:0 "The early chaotic periods of our history saw many nation states vying with each other for power, until we were at last united under the strongest of these. Only when guided by a single vision could we reach our full potential, and an era of stability and scientific progress followed."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MILITARY_JUNTA:0 "Technological progress has been swift, but as our numbers increased the civilian population grew increasingly restless. With our world on the brink of anarchy, the military stepped in to restore the rule of law. A new order was established to safeguard our nation from all threats, both external and internal."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_OLIGARCHY:0 "As we progressed through the technological ages, there were many religions among our people that contended with each other for followers. Gradually, sometimes peacefully and sometimes less so, the true faith found its way to all corners of our world and the faithful were united under a single universal church."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SCIENCE_DIRECTORATE:0 "Through scientific progress, we have managed to stamp out the superstitions that ruled the minds of our ancestors. As reason and rational thought spread among our people, the inefficient nation states that we had until then organized ourselves into were disbanded, and a council of our most accomplished scientists was gathered to rule in their stead."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_PEACEFUL_BUREAUCRACY:0 "Unfortunately, our undisciplined minds were still prone to emotional outbursts that could sometimes lead to violence. As weapons became more deadly with each passing technological age, a complex system of government was devised to protect our citizens from harmful elements - including themselves."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_PLUTOCRATIC_OLIGARCHY:0 "As scientific knowledge increased and new outposts were founded across our world, trade flourished and tied the various nation states together until they became a single entity. Power rested with the merchant princes, the true architects of our achievements as a civilization."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MILITARY_REPUBLIC:0 "Many wars were fought between our early nation states, and those who could not defend themselves disappeared or were absorbed by stronger neighbors. These endless wars fostered a strong martial tradition, and to this day full citizenship is reserved for those who have proved willing to sacrifice themselves in defense of the state."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_REPUBLIC:0 "Great achievements were made, both in the advancement of science and on the spiritual plane as we sought to expand our understanding of the universe and the role we play in it. A council of our most learned priests was convened to advise our elected leaders, a tradition that continues to this day."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DIRECT_DEMOCRACY:0 "As our technology progressed to a level that allowed for instantaneous communications, our inefficient nation states merged together to form a true democracy, with every citizen having a say in important decisions."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MORAL_DEMOCRACY:0 "As we advanced through the technological ages, we also matured as a species. The violent and base impulses we inherited from our ancestors were done away with, and a global government was formed on the principles of peaceful coexistence."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_INDIRECT_DEMOCRACY:0 "We were driven forward by steady scientific progress, and armed conflicts between nation states became increasingly rare. The framework for a global democratic government was eventually laid, and when the last holdouts voluntarily joined we stood united as a single nation."
 START_SCREEN_PART_THREE_WARP:0 "Now, after the successful creation of several experimental subspace fields, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first warp drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"
 START_SCREEN_PART_THREE_HYPERSPACE:0 "Now, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"
 START_SCREEN_PART_THREE_WORMHOLES:0 "Now, after the successful creation of artificial subspace wormholes, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished construction of the first Wormhole Station at the edge of our system. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"
 START_SCREEN_UNE:0 "Much has happened since modern Humans first emerged in Africa some 200,000 years ago. Our kind spread rapidly across most of the globe and soon the first civilizations took form.\n\nScientific progress has been swift, though not without cost. Wars claimed millions of lives even before the atom was tamed, and the turmoil of the 21st century saw the mandate of the United Nations gradually expanded in an effort to create stability. By the early 22nd century the supranational organization had become a de facto world government.\n\nThough some still resent the power wielded by the UN, as evidenced during the Mauritanian Police Action of '88, few can deny the technological breakthroughs that have come out of its sponsored research programs. With the recent completion of the first true starships, mankind is about to embark on a new era of space exploration!"
 START_SCREEN_CM:0 "More than a century has passed since the great ark ship Chrysanthemum carried a quarter million of our ancestors from distant Earth to the garden world we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName]. After a long and perilous journey, the colonists rejoiced when they first saw sunlight again - albeit from a foreign star.\n\nThe early years were difficult. Citizen militias were formed to fight off the lethal alien wildlife that we found ourselves sharing our new home with, and cultivating the terrestrial crops that had been brought proved harder than imagined. Yet for each challenge overcome, we became stronger.\n\nOnce this new world had been tamed, our numbers grew exponentially. The last few decades have seen great leaps in technology, and we are now - finally - ready to reach out and reclaim the stars from whence we came!"
