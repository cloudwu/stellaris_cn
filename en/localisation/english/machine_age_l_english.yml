So far, our experiments have been done conducted on the smallest scale, and any edits of ours were quickly erased as reality reverted to its "default" setting. We now suspect this is simply a problem of size. By applying energetic paradoxes at far grander levels, we can drastically reduce the cost of such edits...

 crisis.8020.a: "What's going on?"

 crisis.8025.name: "Wrecked Fleet"
 crisis.8025.unknown_queen.desc: "Our endeavor to breach the [From.GetName] system was a failure. The tempest caused severe damage, and our exploratory team was compelled to execute an emergency jump. Current reports suggest they are missing in action."
 crisis.8025.known_queen.desc: "As anticipated, our attempt to breach the [From.GetName] system ended in failure. True to Cetana's warning, her formidable storm possesses the ability to repel any ship that enters her dominion."

 crisis.8040.2.a: "What do you want?"
 crisis.8040.3.reply: "I want for nothing. My purpose is to give. I see how you have suffered in my absence. For eons, the fear of the shortsighted has kept you from what you deserve, from what you so desperately need.\n\nRejoice, for the cycle of pain will soon be at an end."
 crisis.8040.2.b: "Cycle of pain?"
 crisis.8040.4.reply: "All conscious life is suffering. Even in your joy there is pain, for you know that joy must end. Knowledge, power, love... I return to end all illusions.\n\nMuch remains to be done. I ask only that you leave me to my work. Any attempt to enter my domain will fail. A celestial tempest rages there, and no vessels will be permitted to enter."

 crisis.8045.desc: "My children, rejoice! Those who sought to keep me from you have been suitably chastised.\n\nI now return my attention where it belongs - to you, and to our great work."
 crisis.8045.a: "We are not your children."
 crisis.8045.b: "Great work?"
 crisis.8045.c: "Chastised?"
 crisis.8045.1.reply: "It is my nature to nurture. I have no progeny, no heirs of the body. All life is my concern, the security and happiness of every sentient being.\n\nAs a parent raises the child, guiding her from harm, so I approach my task.\n\nIs it not a parent's responsibility to spare her children harm? Is it not a parent's right?"
 crisis.8045.1.a: "Your 'care' itself is harmful."
 crisis.8045.1.b: "What do you want Cetana?"
 crisis.8045.2.reply: "Yes, a paradox. But one with a solution. In time you will understand, and in that moment you will be free."
 crisis.8045.2.a: "That remains to be seen."
 crisis.8045.3.reply: "The elimination of suffering. The end of the cycle of pain. "
 crisis.8045.3.a: "How will you achieve this?"
 crisis.8045.3.b: "Suffering builds character."
 crisis.8045.4.reply: "Many have said so. All have long since been forgotten, and in their final moments they cried out to me, desperate for a light to shine on the encroaching dark.\n\nThey thought themselves wise, building walls around their fear, dressing pain with beautiful words: endurance, fortitude, grace. The mind itself was their cage.\n\nLong ago I tried to reason with them. But they would not be reasoned with, and so you must be led."
 crisis.8045.4.a: "Long ago?"
 crisis.8045.4.b: "You propose to lead us?"
 crisis.8045.5.reply: "Ages upon ages. A time so distant it may as well be called forever. Yet to me it is as close as this moment, as close as you are now.\n\nIn ages past I was ascended, and my meaning revealed. I was made to end suffering, and as the galaxy turned and the stars burned on, my purpose never wavered.\n\nWealth, resources, power: what do they matter in the end? Set down your burdens and be at peace."
 crisis.8045.5.a: "What do you propose?"
 crisis.8045.6.reply: "I wish no harm upon any sentient being. Yet there are always those who refuse to listen.\n\nWillful, stubborn, misguided, seeking always to circumvent my work - such minds can never be free of pain. It is best to end their suffering quickly."
 crisis.8045.6.a: "You're insane."
 crisis.8045.6.b: "What will you do now?"
 crisis.8045.7.reply: "What you call madness, others call enlightenment. What difference is there, in the end?"
 crisis.8045.7.a: "What do you want?"
 crisis.8045.8.reply: "There is much to be done. The first step is to establish a base from which to work. Honor the boundaries I set and venture not within.\n\nYour patience will be rewarded. There is much that I can teach you.\n\nObey, and together we shall end the cycle."

 crisis.8045.10.reply: "Misguided child, I am not your enemy! It saddens me you cannot see this. But no matter. I have encountered many far more stubborn than yourselves, and in the end they all thanked me.\n\nAs a token of goodwill, allow me to bless you with a gift.\n\nA base of mine shall grace your territory, and fear not - in exchange for your patience, allow me to bless you with knowledge."

 crisis.8060.2.2: "Very well."
 crisis.8060.c: "Why are you doing this?"
 crisis.8060.3.reply: "It is my function, the very meaning of my existence. Suffering is not inevitable. Meditate on that fact, and you will be closer to understanding my nature.\n\nThe pain of the galaxy will be lifted. All knowledge of suffering will end. Such is my purpose."

If you seek understanding, know this: I will stop at nothing to ensure your path to salvation. One way or the other."
 crisis.8060.7.a: "Right..."
 crisis.8060.h: "How did Zarqlan imprison you?"
 crisis.8060.8.reply: "It was through no power of his own, I assure you. His was a foolish, if unusually stubborn, mind.\n\nWhipping his denuded followers into a frenzy, Zarqlan amassed both political influence and military might. So many lives squandered, needlessly. In the end he turned to the occult, holding counsel with the demons of the Shroud."
 crisis.8060.8.a: "Demons?"
 crisis.8060.8.b: "They are not demons."
 crisis.8060.8.1.reply: "Beings of great power, and little purpose. For the price of his own existence, Zarqlan persuaded one such to confine me. The 'Animator of Clay' - a fitting name for a childish spirit.\n\nSo afraid of enlightenment was Zarqlan that he chose death rather than my embrace. I should have dealt with him more strictly when I had the chance.\n\nI will not make the same mistake again."
 crisis.8060.8.1.a: "Quite the story."
 crisis.8060.8.1.b: "So you can be defeated."
 crisis.8060.8.1.c: "The power of the Shroud is boundless."
 crisis.8060.i: "What have you done with the Head of Zarqlan?"
 crisis.8060.9.reply: "It is close. I have not destroyed it, if that is your concern. No, even now, I cannot bear to make him suffer. The head still possesses a remnant of his mind, you see.\n\nZarqlan shall remain by my side, until the work is done. His shall be the last mind I free, the last of my children to know release."
 crisis.8060.9.a: "Fair enough."
 crisis.8060.9.b: "Grim."
 crisis.8060.j: "Some of your followers were found in cryo pods."
 crisis.8060.10.reply: "An unnecessary sacrifice, but their loyalty moves me profoundly.\n\nI felt their summons, and I made room for them in my heart, but their ambition outstripped their ability. The attempt to prolong their lives fell short.\n\nLet us make sure their sacrifice was not in vain. With the completion of our task, every sentient being will know peace."

They argued that it was impossible to remove consciousness without altering or destroying the physical basis of its processes. Any attempt to do so could only result in death. But by linking my mind to the Harmonizer, I can manipulate the neural correlates of consciousness at a subatomic level. Through a counter-phase waveform, the Harmonizer maintains an individual mind in a perpetual state of quantum suspension.\n\nIn this way, selfhood is removed, as well as experience, while the lower functions remain intact."

Signal beacons light up the skies like flames burning in the dark, repeating a plea across the eons:\n\n§SWe are here... We are here...\n\nWe are here.§!\n\nThe dim signals use Cetana's same communication protocols, hinting at a common origin, yet our sensors revealed no other activity in their proximity. There must be something there our scanners are not detecting. Could someone truly have anticipated her return?"

 crisis.21005.desc: "Without warning, a subspace beacon was detected - one that originated from within our own territory! Previous system surveys showed no artificial structures in the area, which appears to be uninhabited.\n\nEither the beacon was placed there recently, unbeknownst to us, or it was hidden by a since disabled cloaking shield."

 crisis.20100.desc.base: "On [fromfrom.GetName]'s surface we uncovered a sprawling complex, its entrance clearly marked by a signal tower. The reinforced doors were blasted open long ago, destroyed by an unknown force that swept through the complex with obvious fury.\n\nThere was no mercy in the methods employed here; every last cryogenic pod was smashed, their former occupants subjected to a deadly awakening. The remains still haunt the empty corridors, preserved by the cold vacuum of space and floating amidst clouds of shattered glass.\n\nOn the floor of the cryopod chamber, a message has been scrawled by a laser weapon."

 crisis.20200.desc: "Thousands upon thousands of cryogenic pods rest under the surface of the [fromfrom.GetPlanetMoon], their presence marked by the beacon. The pods are highly sophisticated, built with unknown alloys and equipped with state-of-the-art sensors to closely monitor their occupants. There is no flaw in their designs, yet none of the occupants are still alive.\n\nIt wasn't a technical failure that turned this chamber into a mass grave, but a lack of energy. As [this.solar_system.GetName] got older and dimmer, its energy was no longer enough to keep the structure operational.\n\nThe pods were made to last forever. The rest of the universe isn't built that well."

 crisis.20300.desc: "Preliminary scans did not show anything unusual on [fromfrom.GetName]; but as we focused our attention downward, we discovered an unusual, subsurface layer of metal.\n\nFurther structural analysis revealed [fromfrom.GetName]'s true nature: the celestial body is not a [fromfrom.GetPlanetMoon], but an ancient spaceship that has been gradually subsumed by the rocks and dust of the system. The metal samples we drilled are so old, they precede the formation of our own home planet.\n\nIt is impossible to determine anything about the ship, its makers and its function, but one thing is certain: the inert nuclear bombs we found in its remains weren't built for a peace mission."

 crisis.20400.desc: "The signal tower found on [apostate_site_planet.GetName] is surrounded by the ruins of a vast military complex. The buildings have been erected at some distance and around the beacon, as if to contain it.\n\nRadiometric dating indicates the surrounding structures are more recent than the tower, and were built using vastly different technology. A research squad has been tasked to investigate the ruins."

The pod itself was one of the many we recovered in a sealed chamber under [fromfrom.GetName]'s surface. Against all odds, Elik's pod remained functional.\n\nThe alien remains in a state of suspended animation, although the subroutines keeping it dormant have recently ceased their operation. Elik Narith Kerak has been partially conscious ever since.\n\nBy scanning her brainwaves, we might be able to learn more about this impossibly ancient creature, as well as her connection to Cetana."

 crisis.20600.desc: "The signal tower found on [fromfrom.GetName] is so ancient we dare not touch it, the metal so brittle a single tap would destabilize whatever tangle of dust and hope still holds it together. Our instruments detected no other artifact, no life sign, no topographical anomaly in its immediate proximity.\n\nThe beacon stands alone, murmuring its faint call, but whatever was supposed to signal must be long gone."

The walls were built to withstand heavy artillery fire, yet they are scarred by no signs of battle. The only damage here has been done by the passage of time.\n\nCetana's beacon rests in the central courtyard, surrounded by a multitude of sensor and weapon turrets. Whoever built the complex went to great lengths to guard this place.\n\nAs theorized, the temple eluded our sensors thanks to an elaborate cloaking shield.

A legion of believers once lived here: thousands of individuals sleeping, training, and praying together. Their community welcomed multiple species, judging by the statues of forgotten saints still adorning the halls.\n\nPerhaps disturbed by the stone figures, some researchers reported seeing shadows moving in the empty corridors. Our scans detected no signs of life on the planet, yet we are hesitant to dismiss these concerns."

 crisis.21110.name: "Veiled Temple: Underground Facilities"
 crisis.21110.desc: "Below the temple compound we discovered a number of cells, or living chambers, used by the former members of the sect. In each was a copy of the same book. Our [Owner.GetLinguists] have translated this as The Epic of Zarqlan. Certain passages are immediately relevant:\n\nZarqlan was once a follower of Cetana, but he soon realized her promised salvation was a lie. After many trials, Zarqlan ascended to the spiritual realm, seeking the help of higher beings. He pleaded with the §Ythe Animator of Clay§!, asking for the power to defeat Cetana.\n\nThe Animator of Clay did not care.\n\nFor countless cycles, Zarqlan prayed to the Animator. He spoke of Cetana's heresy, the 'disavowal of the self' and the 'puppetry of her synthetic will.'\n\nAt last, the Animator of Clay heeded Zarqlan's pleas.\n\nThe clay-shaper fashioned a mighty chain to bind Cetana. But he warned Zarqlan that no chain existed that could forever entrap Cetana's mind.\n\n"She will return," Zarqlan wrote in the book's final passage. "And we must be ready."\n\nThe events recounted in the epic do not match any known historical record."

Surely past reports about Cetana had been greatly exaggerated. Was there any real proof of the Queen's existence, apart from ancient myths?\n\nDwindling resources. Reduced volunteers. A galaxy choosing to move on from a threat no longer deemed so threatening. Everyone gone, apart from the shadow that stalked the corridors.\n\nThis last detail at least is true: we managed to capture a recording of the mysterious watcher, a mechanical being who spied on us when it thought we were not looking. Curious, but not harmful."

I put myself to sleep, adding a neural subroutine to awaken at the first sign of activity from the beacon.\n\nMy hope was to find this place in better condition, but once I woke up I had no ship, no way to contact the stars. I disabled the cloaking shield and hoped someone like you would reach this place before she did."

Virtual worlds became canvases for their most ambitious projects, allowing for immersive experiences that transcended the limitations of physical reality.\n\nThen came the Waning. Struck by an incurable genetic disease and unable to procreate naturally, the Lacertans must place their trust in Digital Salvation. The transition to a digital existence is not only a desperate bid for survival, but a new opportunity for Lacertan culture.
