 anomaly.6700.desc:0 "As the [Root.GetName]s' crew explored the barren dunes of §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§!, the first reports were much as expected: this is an unnatural wasteland with no signs of life above the water's surface. Yet the planet's aquatic life has evolved well past the point we would expect some species to make forays onto dry land.\n\nAdditionally, the crew discovered what originally appeared to be various ancient-looking, sand-covered structures. Shortly after they began digging into these apparent buildings, small swarms of nanites emerged and began harassing the researchers. It seems the buildings are formed not from sand, but by billions of microscopic nanomachines!\n\nOnce mobilized, these swarms quickly multiplied, awakening more and more of the dormant whole. [Root.GetLeaderName] ordered a swift evacuation of the planet, allowing the [Root.GetName] just enough time to escape the atmosphere with a swarming storm of nanites in hot pursuit. The remaining swarm now seems agitated, and it's not calming down."

 anomaly.6705.desc.end:0 "\nThe robots operated autonomously and attempted to secure the planet according to their programming. Without their creators to rein them in, a battle soon broke out among the machines.\n\nThe emerging victor of this conflict was a hyper-adaptive, self-replicating nanite system that rapidly evolved to fit the planet's biosphere. This machine made itself the master of the surface world, breaking down anything from local flora to its former, robotic rivals.\n\nWe bear witness to the aftermath of this great war: a planet not devoid of life, but instead supporting its evolved apex predator."

The swarm demonstrates a measurable increase in its understanding of our technology."
 anomaly.6710.desc.normal:0 "Some of our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] argue that this behavior is proof that the swarm is a sapient being - or beings - and might even be considered to be alive.\n\nIt is time to make a decision: do we let them be, destroy them, or else attempt to appropriate these beings for our own gain?"
 anomaly.6710.desc.gestalt:0 "These are the behaviors of a budding hivemind, and if left to its own devices, the nanite swarm may achieve sapience. Do we leave it in this state, or do we destroy it before it become a threat? Could we somehow appropriate this entity for our gain?"

Extracting a few from the planet's atmosphere and using our advanced AI technology, we have managed to reprogram the communication systems of the machines. Then when we reintroduced our reprogrammed nanites into the swarm, the modifications spread across the globe in a flash.\n\nWith control of the network secured, our first order was to reintroduce a stable biosphere onto §H[nanite_swarm_planet.GetName]§! - one which is optimized for [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural].

First, they exposed the crystal to the same solar radiation from [From.GetName], producing an identical result to the initially recorded phenomenon. It also seemed to create resonances with all energy waves we sent through it, forming new colors and sounds never before observed by [Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!\n\nSuch frequencies could change the way we view the universe.

# ASR: Asteroid Sensor Relay

 anomaly.6805.name:0 "Asteroid Sensor Relay"
 anomaly.6805.desc:0 "Hoping to discover rare resources inside [From.GetName], our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] stumbled upon something most unusual.

# Crystal Growths Anomaly

 anomaly.6825.name:0 "Crystal Growths"
 anomaly.6825.desc.start:0 "The lifeforms living on [From.GetName] were nothing like we expected. Our [owner.GetScientistPlural] report back that the asteroid has crystal growths.

# Cascading Catastrophe

 anomaly.6845.name:0 "Cascading Catastrophe"
 anomaly.6845.desc:0 "We did indeed discover life on [From.GetName], but by our actions, it has since been eradicated. The microbial creatures which lived in the outer edges of the gas giant's atmosphere reacted poorly to our deep scans. These frequencies caused each creature's cellular structure to resonate - an effect that then cascaded and spread from gas mite to gas mite.

Compared to the traditional size of spores on our homeworld, these are massive. Their surface is a shimmering kaleidoscope, and the hues seem to change based on their surroundings.\n\nThe strangest thing about them is that they seem to form a network capable of generating what the science crew believes could be a signal. The current emissions are very weak, but with some effort, it might be possible to find out where they lead."

Scans and samples show that it is some sort of mycelium, littered with enormous spores and directly related to the 'Fumongus.' Its spores seem, however, to have mutated and grown into small beads. Their ever-changing colorful surface is quite the spectacle, but more importantly, they seem to be producing a stronger signal than the regular spores."

This in turn increased the need for water to supply them, but the nearby frozen asteroids hold enough to hydrate them for centuries, if not millennia.\n\nWith bigger mushrooms came a better network, and after some upgrades to the computing equipment, we are now once again ready to listen to what the spores have to say."

 ### Fumongus Colony Events
 #Events

 colony.2060.name:0 "Mushroom Picking"
 colony.2060.desc:0 "A routine ecological study of our colony on [Root.GetName] has stumbled upon a strange fungal lifeform. The science team reports that the surface of the mycelium is shimmering and colorful, but what was most intriguing to them was the fact that separate clusters were seemingly communicating with one another whenever something occurred within a wide radius.\n\nFurthermore, the biology of the organism appears to be clearly alien to the ecosystem of the colony. Puzzled, the local science team has requested specialized support as we might be dealing with a sentient species."
 colony.2060.a:0 "Dispose of them."
 colony.2060.b:0 "Take a closer look"
 colony.2060.c:0 "... They are related to the Fumongus!"
 colony.2065.name:0 "The Spores Have Ears"
 colony.2065.desc:0 "We have concerning reports coming from [Root.GetName]. Upon further examination, it seems that the alien fungus we found is emitting a signal towards a location in the galaxy that we were unable to pinpoint so far. Telemetry and security analysis indicate that it is completely possible for the mycelium to be some kind of advanced spying organism.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that this organism is old. There is a fair chance that whomever engineered these spying mushrooms is not around anymore. But if they are, it might be best not to poke the sleeping predator."
 colony.2065.a:0 "We need to know more."
 colony.2065.b:0 "This is too risky. Destroy them."
 colony.2070.intro:0 "Careful analysis of the mycelium and the signals showed that it was likely part of a network of similar organisms, possibly spanning across the galaxy as a whole, and maybe beyond. While we do not know much, we discovered that as part of the network, this mycelium was also receiving signals from other places."
 colony.2070.name:0 "Someone is Listening"
 colony.2070.desc:0 "$colony.2070.intro$\n\nWe cannot be certain, but considering several factors, including the volume of data transferred, we believe that someone is actively using the network and collecting information from it. We are already working on a counter-intelligence plan of disinformation, and security measures are being updated empire wide to account for this form of spycraft."
 colony.2070.a:0 "Let the disinformation begin!"
 colony.2075.name:0 "No One Listens"
 colony.2075.desc:0 "$colony.2070.intro$\n\nConsidering several factors, including the volume of data transferred, we do not think that the network is still in use. The fact that it is still partially active indicates that it is probably just dormant and not destroyed."
 colony.2075.a:0 "What can we learn from it?"
 colony.2080.name:0 "Spore Connection"
 colony.2080.desc:0 "Whatever doubts we had about this fungus' connection to the mycelial listening array were quickly dispelled after a brief comparison. This is one of the many offsprings communicating with the Fumongus, and this could be an opportunity to further our comprehension of the organism."
 colony.2080.a:0 "See if we can strengthen the network."
 colony.2080.b:0 "Use it to keep a closer eye on the colony."
 colony.2080.c:0 "We dismantled the network, but we can still study it."
 colony.2085.name:0 "Unrest on [Root.GetName]"
 colony.2085.desc:0 "Word about our project to use the local mycelium to closely monitor the colony has spread, and it wasn't well received. Despite our best efforts to defuse the situation, the local population widely considers this as a breach of trust and are demanding that we put an end to this project immediately.\n\nThe situation is escalating quickly, and our local enforcers are overwhelmed. They would need help to maintain control of the colony if we choose to go on with the project."
 colony.2085.a:0 "The population is right. Abort."
 colony.2085.b:0 "If they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear."
 colony.2090.name:0 "The Spores Are Our Ears"
 colony.2090.desc:0 "We have grown the mycelium on [Root.GetName], and fine-tuned the local computing equipment to sort through the interference. The responsible team reports that the network is now closely monitoring the colonists. Already, a number of petty criminals have been sanctioned appropriately.\n\nUnfortunately, attempts at replicating the installation in other places have met with failure. It is likely that some unknown factor is at play here."
 colony.2095.name:0 "Fungal Failure"
 colony.2095.desc:0 "Our efforts to stimulate the spread of the mycelium on [Root.GetName] have resulted in the growth of more 'traditional' mushrooms. An incident with some colonists has shown them to be edible. This event has thrown the whole network off balance for a while, but it now appears to be stabilized and functional. However, no significant improvement has been noticed overall. It looks like these mushrooms are merely storage for water. They do not contribute to the network and their destruction has no impact on it either."
 colony.2095.a:0 "Harvest them."
 colony.2095.b:0 "Study them. "

Below, the undergrowth teems with life: limbless predators; droop-faced primates; swarms of hematophagous insects. The forest floor is loamy, and pools of fetid water have caused the team significant delays. What's more, something - either the density of the foliage or an as yet undefined electrical interference - has prevented much of their equipment from functioning properly.\n\nThe project's lead believes they should still be able to forge a path through the trees, though progress is likely to be slow."

Far from the lush jungle world that exists today, the planet was once rocky and barren. The project lead believes the great trees themselves are responsible: a resonance imaging scan detected the presence of psionic energy within their sap. Pulled from groundwater by the trees' vast root systems, this energy is eventually diffused throughout the planet's atmosphere in a process akin to photosynthesis. It is highly likely that this is the cause of the team's malfunctioning equipment.\n\nInterestingly, the presence of moonlight appears to accelerate the psionic diffusion. On clear nights, the air itself seems to vibrate, a phenomenon that has only grown in intensity as the team nears its destination. This is unlike anything we've ever seen before."

Our translation algorithms have succeeded in decoding much of the symbology, and this particular image likely represents the planet's moon.\n\nWithin the cave, the presence of psionic energy is off the charts.

The bridge resembles the deck of an old planetbound sailing ship designed to sail on watery seas.\n\nThe deck plating appears to be metal, but most surfaces are covered with carved wood, a contrast to the glass-like substance on viewports and datascreens.\n\nPowering up the ship's computers, we have found a datafile with an old-fashioned seafarers' song.

Our own 'sailors' now have a habit of singing versions of their own space shanties, which should improve their morale and efficiency.\n\n'We rose from the ocean\nAnd reached for the sky\nWe're building an empire\nThat never will die!\n\n'And it's windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys\nWhen the wind blows, then we're all together, boys\nBlow ye winds fringeward, hey!

It appears that the strong magnetic field produced by some sort of cloaking device hid it from our ship's sensors, and the camouflaged entrance remained invisible to the autonomous research probes mapping the surface.\n\nOn the other hand, more specialized tests have shown that delivering a steady stream of energy should make the door operational again, eventually allowing us to open it and see what's inside."

 colony.9201.desc:0 "As energy flowed through the circuits, the entrance came online, and with additional tinkering, we quickly discovered how the door worked. Additional topographical research revealed the interior to be a large underground vault. Alien infrastructure covered every square centimeter of the walls - even the huge pillars supporting the ceiling showed faint energy signatures. Given the energy readings and vague similarities to our technology, it appears to be an underground manufacturing facility."
 colony.9201.a:0 "We will learn it secrets." #go forward

The first room within the vault is a giant hall, stretching deep into the mountain, with several branching corridors pushing even further into the depths. Various ornate plaques decorate stone chiseled pillars, each depicting the alien race that presumably built this place. We can't decipher their language, but the story told by those art pieces are centered on warfare, struggle, and grandiose projects.\n\nMore disturbing is the loss of an entire construction unit; after reporting the presence of strange sounds in the dark, the unit simply vanished.

Their appearances are cyclical, much like dihydrogen-monoxide based puddles.\n\nA fascinating discovery. Our understanding of the elements continues to grow." #This string contains a linguistic joke of appending 'onium' to the end of a planet name to create a new chemical element, e.g. 'Earthonium'.

 colony.9350.name: "Myrmeku Activity"
 colony.9350.desc: "Since settling on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, we have noted increased arthropod activity. Specifically, tiny colony-building insects designated "Myrmeku" have become unexpectedly productive.\n\nTheir underground colonies are spread across the continent in great numbers, but until now they have never caused an issue. It is unknown if they are searching for something above ground or fleeing from something beneath."

 colony.9355.name: "[Owner.GetColonistPluralCapital] Attacked"
 colony.9355.desc: "Our [Owner.GetColonistPlural] on §Y[Root.GetName]§! have been viscously attacked! Venturing too close to a Myrmeku colony, they were swarmed. As the tiny insects entered openings in the [Owner.GetColonistPlural]' frames, the victims were quickly overwhelmed.\n\nThe fallen [Owner.GetColonistPlural] were immediately disassembled, but no conclusive data was collected as to the insects' purpose. The craggy surface of the Myrmeku's magnetic exoskeletons damage our internal circuitry, and when two Myrmeku touch, they create a tiny electrical spark; both of which may cause catastrophic failure.\n\nLosing [Owner.GetColonistPlural] this way has slowed down the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s development rate. Something must be done."
 colony.9355.a: "Find a solution."

 colony.9360.name: "Memory Eaters"
 colony.9360.desc: "With astounding speed, the Myrmeku have built several sprawling structures close to our settlement. Their attacks are no longer limited to the perimeter, but have also begun inside housing structures.\n\nThe large number of subjects available for autopsy has revealed the disturbing reason why the Myrmeku are interested in us: The insects consume the insulation material of our §Ymemory chips§!.\n\nThis is only fatal for the victim in the short term, as memory circuits can be replaced and backups restored. However, replacing the parts means delays for the construction of new [Owner.GetColonistPlural]."

By building flood barriers we can protect our remaining cities, but more unforeseeable consequences still linger on the horizon."
 colony.7245.a: "The planet is flooding!"
 colony.7247.name: "Secrets of the Permafrost"
 colony.7247.desc: "As the meltdown of the planet [flooding_planet.GetName] continues, a fascinating discovery was made beneath the permafrost. An astonishingly abundant polar reservoir of minerals and rare resources lies waiting, beckoning us with untold wealth and untapped potential."
 colony.7247.a: "Jackpot. Start drilling!"
 colony.7247.b: "The permafrost has suffered enough."
 colony.7247.b.tooltip: "We cannot risk worsening the situation."
 colony.7250.name: "Unfrozen Pathogen"
 colony.7250.desc: "A disconcerting development has unfolded at our polar mining station on [flooding_planet.GetName]. Workers have succumbed to sudden bouts of unconsciousness, necessitating the implementation of a stringent no-pass zone for their safety.\n\nInitial investigations suggest the emergence of a dormant virus, awoken as its icy confines were disturbed. The true nature and characteristics of this awakened pathogen remain uncertain, leaving us grappling with a multitude of unanswered questions. The extent of its transmissibility and the potential danger it poses to the people remains undetermined."

 colony.7260.name: "Climate Stabilized"
 colony.7260.desc: "We have reached an environmental breakthrough.\n\nThe innocuous byproducts generated through the combustion of our fuels harbor an insidious side-effect when coming to contact with [flooding_planet.GetName]'s bacterial clouds. We now know that these clouds play a vital role in retaining the planet's natural biorhythm by working as a solar shield. As the bacteria slowly begun to diminish, we inadvertently exacerbated the effect of our emissions.\n\nArmed with this newfound knowledge, resolute measures have been swiftly enacted to restore the equilibrium."
