As we built our civilization, our minds scanned for shadows in the night. We toiled in the places where we built our first cities, always testing their foundations.\n\nThousands of years later, I had the temerity to look *up*.While others labored with their gaze downcast, my mind opened up to the heavens. Building a temple of circuitry and steel, I formed my own tools, empowered by the light of my intellect. Perfecting a labyrinth of diodes and capacitors, I cast my consciousness through the cosmos, perceiving something beyond the dark skies that shrouded our world.\n\nFor I could sense what others could not: We were not alone in the universe.

We tentatively reach out to others, yet so many of us are alone. Our gods crafted the world from darkness, we are told, and we were allegedly the centerpiece of their creation.\n\nBecause I dared to dream of worlds beyond, I was told my vision was a lie. Who among us, others asked, could confirm these dreams? How can we believe, they said, what we cannot prove? And in response, I led those who would listen to my laboratory. The brightest minds could perceive a reflection of what I experienced: other worlds beyond the veil of night.\n\nThe darkest minds crafted other responses, formed new arguments, clutched deadly weapons. Dangerous minds sang that our world would be in turmoil, for we were no longer the favored spawn of the gods. Yet I knew the truth: Creation's illumination was a vast tapestry.

Enshrouded beyond the endless night, other minds dreamed, and I sought communion with them. Beyond a great darkness, a great Light led me on, offering me temptations and endless revelations. And thus I cast my mind out further into the unknown...\n\nAs above, so below. My visions of the heavens brought me joy, but down below, I found someone who brought me the same liberation of happiness. I fell in love with another scientist, a visionary who spoke of other ways to seek the stars I had sensed in my reveries.\n\nWe did more than share a vision. We pledged ourselves as partners for life. And as our work progressed, we stayed up later each night.

I neglected My Beloved. As we pursued our dreams of venturing into the cosmos, a gulf grew between us.\n\nMy Beloved found words for our phenomenon: quantum entanglement. My body was here, but my mind was aeons away, desperately seeking ecstasy and a communion with eternity. My partner told me other words, but I would not listen. 'My Love,' they said, 'come back to me,' but I could only hear the echoes of the stars.\n\nSoon, the time will come to test my partner's solar starship. I have volunteered sit at the controls. As I sit at the helm of its first test flight, I will dream of a course to distant shores, my mind *here* and my body *there*.\n\nMy Beloved has grown quiet, but I will gift them with infinity, blazing a trail to eternity.

Sitting at the controls aboard our first test flight, they merged with infinity, overwhelmed by rapturous psychic contemplation of the heavens. Our test ship never returned.\n\nNow I labor with my own crude tools, left to reforge my work and my life from the wreckage. More of my solar starships have begun their journeys into the Great Night. I have begun work on better engines, prototypes that can propel our vessels through hyperspace. And on some nights, I dream of a technology that can leap for the stars like the mind and soul of my lost partner, launching us into the unknown.\n\nAs I reach for the light, I refuse to succumb to the darkness.

I am left wondering if we can take that same reckless path, empowered by the Quantum Architect's designs, but I reach for the stars at a slower pace. I search for a wave to ride through hyperspace, contemplating a current that will take us to distant shores.\n\nMy ships take the slow route, but late at night, I read My Love's journals, struggling to tame their mathematics and machinations. As my mind reaches out towards eternity, I know in my heart that My Love is still out there. They blazed a trail towards heaven, and I must follow.\n\nThrough loss, I have found inspiration. We have begun work on a grand machine that will propel our ships across the galaxy, just as My Beloved leapt into infinity. And someday, I will do what they have done. When I am gone, I humbly request that this cosmic device and all its iterations should include the personal logs of the Quantum Architect. Doubtless by the time others read this, my soul will have taken taken flight. I will have found a way to join My Beloved out there in the vast expanse. For I know that we will dwell in eternity together, dreaming and drifting through a thousand points of light."
