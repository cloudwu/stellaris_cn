 SCHOLARIUM_PLANETARY_SENSORS:0 "Scholarium Sensor Abnormality"
 SCHOLARIUM_PLANETARY_SENSORS_DESC:1 "We have picked up on uncommon signals coming from [From.GetName], seemingly trying to initiate contact with us. We have been unable to communicate with whatever or whoever it is, and will have to send a ship to inspect it more closely if we want to learn more about what it might be."

 ## Scripted Loc for Planetary Sensors
 # First Part
 SensorReadings1:0 "They came across the debris of a ship which had crashed at the location, still sending out weak signals every now and then."
 SensorReadings2:0 "They found an old mining station in orbit, seemingly abandoned by their owners a long time ago."
 SensorReadings3:0 "The hunt for the weak signal led them to a small empty outpost, yet there were signs that someone of a similar technological level to our own had been there fairly recently."
 SensorReadings4:0 "All across the signal beacon site were pieces of hull and other detritus which must have come from a larger starbase at one point - yet no other signs of such a structure remain."

 # Second Part
 SensorReadingsSociety1:0 "As they searched through the site, they managed to find a seemingly vacant lifepod with what looked like it the remains of an unknown, alien lifeform. They will bring the sample back for further tests as soon as they can."
 SensorReadingsSociety2:0 "One of the machines responsible for the signals we had picked up on was still somewhat operable, and our team managed to extract some files about the civilization it supposedly hails from. As they are previously unknown to us they will be entered into our databases - though they seem to be from a much older era."
 SensorReadingsSociety3:0 "Though uninhabited by sentient beings, it is the breeding grounds for a group of animals, who have seemingly learned to use some of the broken machinery as part of their courtship display. Our team will bring some of them back to be monitored further."
 SensorReadingsSociety3Gestalt:0 "It seems the local wildlife have started using the machinery from the interior as part of their courtship display. Though usually of little interest to us, our drones will bring some of these curious beings back to be monitored further."
 SensorReadingsSociety4:0 "As they sifted through the area, they came across a small library with books they think detail the biology of various local fauna, from the many different planets the original inhabitants had visited. Our team will bring them back and start deciphering the language used in the books, and add whatever information they can glean from them to our own databases."
 SensorReadingsSociety4Gestalt:0 "After scouring the location, our drones discovered a small library. The books inside detailed the biology of thousands of exo-fauna, specimens from each of the planets the original inhabitants visited. These will be brought back to improve our own database."

 SensorReadingsPhysics1:0 "Though not much of use was left behind, our team managed to find some research papers on geological activity from different planets - or at least so they think, based on the illustrations. They will bring everything they think can survive the journey back, to be deciphered as soon as possible."
 SensorReadingsPhysics1Gestalt:0 "Though very few useful materials were left behind, our engineering drones did locate some research papers on geological activity from different planets. Everything that can survive the journey back will be returned, and deciphered as soon as possible."
 SensorReadingsPhysics2:0 "Our team spent a significant amount of time trying to crack the defenses on those machines which are still active, only to find they contained nothing of real interest. The machines themselves have piqued their interest though, and they will bring some parts back."
 SensorReadingsPhysics2Gestalt:0 "After devoting a considerable amount of time to crack the defenses of the machines responsible for the signals, we now believe they may hold secrets yet to be divulged. Whatever parts we can salvage will be brought back right away."
 SensorReadingsPhysics3:0 "They found a small machine which seems to be responsible for a weak barrier surrounding the area - probably the only reason there's anything to be found in the first place. With nothing else of value there, they have spent their time picking it apart, to see what they can learn from it."
 SensorReadingsPhysics4:0 "It seems a fusion reactor was keeping what was left of the place still running, in spite of a lack of care or maintenance. Our team have taken a special interest in it, and will investigate it further."
 SensorReadingsPhysics4Gestalt:0 "An old fusion reactor was keeping what was left of the place still running, in spite of the lack of necessary maintenance. Our engineering drones will investigate it further to see if there is anything we can learn from it."

 SensorReadingsEngineering1:0 "When they were combing through the ruins of the place, our specialists managed to find some mostly intact ship parts. Though no longer functional due to degradation over time, our engineers believe they can sift some information from them."
 SensorReadingsEngineering1Gestalt:0 "As they combed the ruins, our drones came upon several ship parts. Though no longer functional due to degradation over time, we believe we can sift some information from the pieces."
 SensorReadingsEngineering2:0 "Though it is somewhat desolate, our specialists have found several uses of a building material they have never seen before. When they have finished their excavations and analysis of the area, samples will be brought back for further testing."
 SensorReadingsEngineering2Gestalt:0 "Our drones have come upon a particular building material unlike any we have ever seen before. Though it is unlikely that it can be of use to us, it will be brought back to be analyzed further."
 SensorReadingsEngineering3:0 "Though there are no sentient beings to be found, our excavators found several drones when they dug a bit deeper. Though they are damaged beyond the point of being able to be reverse-engineered in their totality, our technicians believe their disparate parts might teach us new building techniques."
 SensorReadingsEngineering3Gestalt:0 "Our excavation drones came upon a signal somewhat similar to our own network, and after digging a bit deeper a pair of old broken automatons. Though damaged beyond repair, we believe we can reverse-engineer some of their parts to gain greater insight into how they once worked."
 SensorReadingsEngineering4:0 "As they were sifting through the ruins they found the remains of a small vault that once held materials, now empty - and most likely stolen by pirates, perhaps ages ago. They left behind some blueprints of how the original inhabitants had been mining these very same materials however, which might come in handy."

 SensorReadingsRare1:0 "Despite the damage done to the rest of the location, our team managed to find a machine entirely unscathed by time, wildlife, or pirates. They believe it might hold the secrets of a scientific breakthrough, as soon as they can decipher them."
 SensorReadingsRare1Gestalt:0 "Though most of the location is falling apart, our drones managed to find a machine entirely unscathed by time, wildlife, or pirates. We hope that it might divulge some long forgotten secrets - once we manage to decipher it."
 SensorReadingsRare2:0 "As they were about to leave the area, our team came across a cabinet of blueprints and research papers. Not only were they supposedly easy to decipher, but our specialists believe some of them might shine a light on some research we had only recently begun working on ourselves."
 SensorReadingsRare2Gestalt:0 "As we looked through the area one last time, one of our maintenance drones came across a cabinet of blueprints and research papers. Not only were they easy to decipher, but we believe they might shine a light on some research we had only recently begun working on ourselves."

 # First Half
 ResourceDiscovery1:0 "Just beneath the surface of [Root.GetName] we found an dilapidated structure, hidden away by the passage of time. Though its framework remains somewhat intact, there is nothing worth salvaging inside the building itself. However, we have discovered a passage delving further underground."
 ResourceDiscovery2:0 "We found a group of smaller, bewildered machines at [Root.GetName], still trying to execute their designated task. The machines were grouped together at a focal point blocked by debris and dismantled equipment. The main hub is offline and mostly useless, though a signal occurring at regular intervals and leading deeper underground has given us a clear direction to follow."
 ResourceDiscovery3:0 "Our early analysis of [Root.GetName] uncovered a basic research center around a hole on the surface that led to a massive underground cavern. With the research center and its machinery entirely unsalvageable, we have refocused on surveying the cavern."
 ResourceDiscovery4:0 "After an exhaustive survey of the surface of [Root.GetName] we discovered a probe that was engaged in an intensive scan of the region. No matter what we do or how we try to interfere, the probe will inevitably return to that one spot to continue its operations. Following its pattern of behavior, we have begun to survey the ground beneath."
 ResourceDiscovery5:0 "We have come across an old and ruined mining or research station at [Root.GetName]. It seems likely that this crashed to the surface at some point in the past. It also shows signs of having been attacked. Despite the extensive damage, the station is continuing to direct a signal underground. Before moving on, we should no doubt investigate this further."

 # Second Half - Energy
 ResourceDiscoveryEnergy1:0 "It seems to have been attached to an electric current running below the surface, the origin of which remains unclear.  What's more, we have no way to determine how long the current will last, or if it is entirely stable, but we believe we can make use of it."
 ResourceDiscoveryEnergy2:0 "It appears to have been built to keep an archaic generator alive and hidden just below the surface, and despite all the equipment problems one might expect the generator appears to be running fine. With some work, we should be able to stabilize it and make use of it ourselves."
 ResourceDiscoveryEnergy3:0 "When we looked further into the mysterious generator, we found it is attached to several large cables running throughout [Root.GetName]. The whole thing seems to be run by a single apparatus housed far below the surface. With only a slight modification to the current, we can probably make use of the energy it creates."

 # Second Half - Minerals
 ResourceDiscoveryMinerals1:0 "The generator is attached to a mineral vein buried below ground, once probably an important source of raw material for whoever was in charge of the machine's operations. Though somewhat diminished, we can make use of these resources ourselves."
 ResourceDiscoveryMinerals2:0 "Further exploration revealed the generator is connected to a dim grotto complete with several smaller veins of minerals. Scattered about the floor were the bodies of a previously unknown lithoid species. It is unclear if they were harvesting the minerals or eating them straight from the ground, but in either case the bodies are encrusted with mineral protrusions that may well prove useful to us."
 ResourceDiscoveryMinerals3:0 "The generator is built within a gigantic underground chamber, filled to the brim with minerals of all kinds. Emptying the grotto is going to be an endeavor in itself. Digging is likely to result in the need to push deeper into the world's crust."

 # Second Half - Alloys
 ResourceDiscoveryAlloys1:0 "Further exploration of the area revealed it is connected to an ancient apparatus somehow still continuing its operations. Using the resources on hand, the machine continues to spit out well-forged and entirely pristine bricks of useful alloys."
 ResourceDiscoveryAlloys2:0 "We have uncovered an odd storage facility filled with battered ship parts. Though the parts themselves are unsalvageable, we could possibly reuse some of the materials."
 ResourceDiscoveryAlloys3:0 "Extended surveys of the region led to the discovery of a hangar bay hidden deep below ground. Around the rooms we find several decayed ships, with no signs of whoever once owned them. Though recreating the ships that once stood in the hangar will be difficult, we should be able to salvage the parts for our own purposes."

 # Second Half - Rare Crystals
 ResourceDiscoveryRareCrystals1:0 "It seems to have been connected to the mining operations of an unusual and oddly off-putting type of crystal growth, though there is no sign of whoever must have been in charge of this facility. With some minor adjustments, we should be able to make use of it ourselves."
 ResourceDiscoveryRareCrystals2:0 "It led to a grotto teeming with delicate crystalline creatures - perhaps some sort of underground farm or breeding grounds. Long abandoned, the creatures are now free to roam as they wish. As they seem friendly and welcoming, we should be able to restore the farm if we so wish."
 ResourceDiscoveryRareCrystals3:0 "Following it revealed a rickety mine shaft filled with drones still hacking away at crystalline protrusions on the walls. Undisturbed by our presence, they worked continually to fill and set aside large crates. Though many of the crystals are common varieties and largely worthless, there are some rare ones to be found among them."

 # Second Half - Volatile Motes
 ResourceDiscoveryVolatileMotes1:0 "Following it we come across the den of a bulbous amphibian creature, with vibrant, oddly unnatural particles vibrating through in the air around it. It is unclear why these particles are so attracted to the creature, but we believe that with a little work, we can stabilize and make use of them ourselves."
 ResourceDiscoveryVolatileMotes2:0 "As we continued our explorations, we discovered a compact facility further below, with several rooms and machines set aside for stabilizing volatile motes. Though safe for now, they will soon reach a critical stage of disrepair, and we should focus our efforts on restoring them before they fall apart."
 ResourceDiscoveryVolatileMotes3:0 "The chamber leading us further underground, we eventually came across a grotto filled with toxic waste, slowly eating away at the ground. Though dangerous, it seems to be the source of the volatile motes we discovered earlier. We should be able to make use of these, as long as we are careful with the stabilization process."

 # Second Half - Exotic Gases
 ResourceDiscoveryExoticGases1:0 "For some reason, it seems to be connected to a waste disposal site deep below the ground. The site is so ancient that it will likely prove impossible to speculate on its origins, but we believe we can harvest some of these toxic gases for our own purposes."
 ResourceDiscoveryExoticGases2:0 "It seems to have been attached to a crowded research facility centered around a natural occurrence of toxic gases stemming from the core of [Root.GetName]. Readjusting the facility somewhat should allow us to harvest these for ourselves."
 ResourceDiscoveryExoticGases3:0 "It led further below the surface where we came across a machine of incredible proportions, probably once used to stabilize [Root.GetName], but now damaged beyond repair. Though unsalvageable, the machine's damaged state has led to the creation of several toxic gases that we might make use of."

 # Second Half - Zro
 ResourceDiscoveryZro1:0 "As we continued to follow it, we found a source of zro buried deep below the surface. Exotic harvesting tools littered the chamber floor, and with a little ingenuity we should be able to make use of them ourselves."
 ResourceDiscoveryZro2:0 "It is connected to a defunct facility hidden in the depths below. The facility itself appears intended to survey a zro impact site. Though empty and largely offline, it should eventually be possible to reuse it for our own purposes."

 # Second Half - Dark Matter
 ResourceDiscoveryDarkMatter1:0 "Through a complex process, it seems to be attached to a research drone. Circling a micro black hole located far below the planet's surface the drone has somehow managed to stabilize the singularity, perhaps in an effort to research it. Though we are unable to replicate this technological feat, we should be able to utilize the drone for our own means."

 # Second Half - Living Metal
 ResourceDiscoveryLivingMetal1:0 "We have discovered that it leads to a chamber further below the surface. There we chanced upon a beguiling amalgamation of living metal and what we believe was once a molluscoid creature. It seems the two have fused together, slowly expanding through the cavern networks below the ground. With some effort, we should be able to start chipping pieces off the metal, for our own uses, without doing the creature too much harm."
 ResourceDiscoveryLivingMetal2:0 "It didn't take long for us to find the living metal is centered on a narrow grotto. As it slithers and reacts to touch, we believe it might be more alive than one might first think. If we harvest it carefully, we should be able to maximize our use of the creature, without killing it."

 prospectorium_resource_discovery_desc:0 "We have picked up on signals indicating there might be more valuable resources to be uncovered at [prospectorium_discovery_target.System.GetName]. We have sent some preliminary drones to scour the region - so it will be ready for further analysis and work when we can send a ship there."

 # Subject presets flavor text
 preset_bulwark_flavor_desc:0 "This subject specializes in military affairs. They are known for their excellence in defensive matters, providing insight and protection for their overlord. In turn, their single-minded focus makes them highly reliant on material support to keep their empire running."
 preset_scholarium_flavor_desc:0 "This subject specializes in research and science. With almost their entire budget focused on supporting their academics and researchers, they are in dire need of protection from their overlord, who receives incredible technology for their troubles."
 preset_prospectorium_flavor_desc:0 "This subject specializes in materials and manufacturing. Their keen senses allow them to dig up the most valuable minerals from regions others have already given up on, making the most out of every asteroid or moon out there."
 preset_tributary_flavor_desc:0 "A tributary is a fairly autonomous subject, still in charge of their own affairs both internally and politically. They pay a considerable amount of tribute for their overlord's protection, and as long as the money is flowing, they are mostly free to do whatever they want."
 preset_vassal_flavor_desc:0 "A vassal is a subject of another empire, often with little to no self-rule. Having signed a pact with a foreign power, they are often at the whims and mercy of their overlord, forced to bend to whatever rules and regulations their liege wishes. For some weakened empires, this is the final stopgap before they are consolidated properly into the fold, as they are signing away their autonomy bit by bit."
 preset_protectorate_flavor_desc:0 "A protectorate is a subject that is considerably weaker than their overlord, reduced to the point where their vassalage is considered a boon to them. Protected from the dangers of the greater galaxy, they can stabilize and improve their homeland as their liege looks out for them."
 preset_subsidiary_flavor_desc:0 "A subsidiary is a subject with a considerable amount of self-rule, free to attend to their own affairs. They have signed away some of their independence for a deal where both sides are expected to support and aid one another."
 preset_dominion_flavor_desc:0 "A dominion serves as a subject to an ancient awakened empire. With old yet powerful warships crossing their borders, they have subjected themselves to the rule of an overly zealous overlord who demands their subjugation in name and spirit."
 preset_satellite_flavor_desc:0 "A satellite serves as a subject to an ancient awakened empire. Having signed away their self-rule to a foreign power, they are constantly governed by their liege: every little piece of cultural significance - whether that's technology, the arts, or another form of expression - is carefully regulated from afar."
 preset_signatory_flavor_desc:0 "A signatory serves as a subject to an ancient awakened empire. Though ruled from afar, they are in many ways left alone to attend to their own matters. Because they are not subjected to tribute or too many regulations, they are often unclear what the goals of their liege might be."
 preset_thrall_flavor_desc:0 "A thrall serves as a subject to an ancient awakened empire. Subjected to a harsh rule from afar, they pay a considerable amount of wealth to their ambitious overlord, who uses their vassals' wealth to fuel their own war machines."
 preset_scion_flavor_desc:0 "A scion serves as a subject to an ancient awakened empire. Long supported by an ancient philanthropic benefactor, they are autonomous in almost all aspects of their rule. They occasionally receive gifts or aid from their liege for reasons unfathomable to the rest of the galaxy."
 preset_satrapy_flavor_desc:0 "A satrapy serves as a subject to the Great Khan. Having bent to the military might of the marauders, they have been given the right to govern their region of the galaxy in the Great Khan's name. As long as they continue to support the marauders' ongoing conquests with ships and resources, they are left to attend to their own matters."
 preset_relic_satrapy_flavor_desc:0 "A satrapy was the subject style favored by the Great Khan, now with a new leader on the throne it would be a waste to toss away such tradition. In return for supporting their Overlord's ongoing conquests with ships and resources, they are left to attend to their own matters."
