 manifesti.1.name:0 "Carnival Protestors"
 manifesti.1.desc:0 "Protests are springing up across [this.GetName]. These large and colorful assemblies have gathered in support of singularly frivolous issues: from the right to hold public dances inside financial institutions to which colors should be painted onto our defense platforms.\n\nThe protests are not violent, but they are noisy - some of the civic services on [this.GetName] have been placed under strain by the disruption. The same cannot be said for the general public however, who - rather than being inconvenienced - seem instead to be enjoying the quirky demonstrations."
 manifesti.1.a:0 "We should get to the bottom of this."
 manifesti.5.name:0 "The Manifesti"
 manifesti.5.desc:0 "The protests on [Root.GetName] have ceased almost as suddenly as they began. Rumors about their origins abound, but many whispers speak of a group called §HThe Manifesti§!.\n\n$manifesti.5.end$"
 manifesti.5.investigated.desc:0 "The protests on [Root.GetName] have ceased almost as suddenly as they began. When participants were pressed for names, many claimed they were influenced by a group called §HThe Manifesti§!.\n\n$manifesti.5.end$"
 manifesti.5.end:0 "This enigmatic collective seems to have responsible for a number of provocative art projects in recent years; their subject matter every bit as spurious as the issues we're seeing protested on [Root.GetName]."

 manifesti.10.name:0 "Nipped in the Bud"
 manifesti.10.desc:0 "Our efforts to apprehend members of §HThe Manifesti§! proved difficult, but have now yielded results. Once the slew of sympathetic pretenders could be sorted from the actual instigators, all Manifesti activities stopped.\n\nA great deal of public scrutiny is now coming to bear on our attitudes towards censorship, not least because this movement had encouraged such liberal thinking. Nevertheless, there has been a marked decline in vandalism and other civil distractions."
 manifesti.10.a:0 "Let us hope that's the end of such nonsense."
 manifesti.15.name:0 "Pictures Grunt a Thousand Words"
 manifesti.15.desc:0 "A subversive dialect has taken root within our art centers and educational institutions. Its origins lie in another project penned by §HThe Manifesti§!.\n\nLinguists note that in this so-called 'Uslurp-Speak', all words relating to our economy have been replaced with expressive grunts. More worryingly, its many and colorful insults all seem to derive from the names of prominent military figures. This has drawn formal complaints from the individuals' families."
 manifesti.15.a:0 "Keep an eye on this, for now."
 manifesti.15.b:0 "This crosses a line, and demands a swift response."
 manifesti.20.name:0 "Mirrors, Brightly"
 manifesti.20.desc:0 "§HThe Manifesti§! have unveiled their most public exhibition to date. A new and extremely popular interactive experience on [this.GetName] invites visitors to manipulate reflections and images of themselves, and to create distorted collages of political figures - some from §Hother galactic empires§!.\n\nCritics herald these pieces as casting a necessarily and harsh light upon our sense of self. The exhibition has also inspired a number of other satirical works both on domestic issues, and on pan-species relations.\n\nDebate amongst our social researchers is lively; more conservative voices urge caution."
 manifesti.20.a:0 "A bold statement."
 manifesti.20.b:0 "A diplomatic disaster waiting to happen. Shut them down."
 manifesti.25.name:0 "Rise of the Manifestists"
 manifesti.25.desc:0 "Rumors abound that a new faction may be formed, inspired by so-called 'Manifestism'. Its proponents speak of contradictory and bizarre causes, such as free movement of rivers and greater personal autonomy for munitions. Existing factions complain that their own events are being disrupted by these Manifestists, whose spurious queries are interfering with acts of everyday governance."
 manifesti.25.b:0 "We must root out these time-wasters."
 manifesti.30.name:0 "A Hush Descends"
 manifesti.30.desc:0 "The buzz surrounding the §YManifesti faction§! has quietened, fading as quickly as the arrival of protests which started it. Some activists we spoke to claimed their motivations ranged from pure satire to conscientious objection.\n\nAttendance at galleries and museums has never been higher, but the public gaze has already moved on to newer, controversial groups of artists. Our sociologists continue to sift through data they gathered during this strange moment in [root.GetAdj] cultural history."
 manifesti.30.a:0 "Life goes on, apparently."
