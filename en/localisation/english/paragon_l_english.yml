 paragon.3132.desc:1 "A vast starbase orbited the planet.

As the admiral ordered his fleet into the darkness, the vision abruptly ended.\n\nReturning aboard with the fragment, §YKeides§! placed it next to the existing piece.

Now he understood its use, and the astonishing scope of its power. When properly controlled, it has the ability to collapse two points in space, effectively creating a stable wormhole. The Vagrosians called this device a §YKey§!.\n\nSpurred by his discovery, §YKeides§! acted on his own initiative to open a wormhole in our home system.

At once a single voice boomed out.\n\n'Attend,' it said. 'For the time of judgement is at hand. The Keys will be taken. Here you shall remain, until the end of all things.'\n\nThe cries of the people were deafening. In the midst of his vision, Keides understood that his world had been abandoned. Their masters, an off-world species of unimaginable power, had found his people lacking. The Keys (and the stable wormholes they produced) were all that connected his world to the wider galaxy. Cut off from galactic trade, the foundation of his people's prosperity was suddenly, and irretrievably, lost."

 paragon.3154.name:0 "Second Vision Report"
 paragon.3154.desc:1 "As a mercy, the Vagrosians were given a month to yield all Keys and related materials. In truth, it was more insult than mercy and not nearly sufficient to save themselves. As an administrative world, the planet did not have the means to sustain its vast population. The best they could hope for was to ration what they had, delaying the time of their starvation. Their off-world masters were well aware of this.\n\nHowever, even in their despair, the planet's leaders hatched a plan. Recent forays into advanced cryopreservation and genomics had afforded them an unlikely opportunity."

Keides was born without parents, the product of genetic engineering. Encoded within his very DNA lay the memories of his people. Upon his maturity, contact with the Key would allow him to access these memories in the form of visions.\n\nAlongside this plan, the planet's leaders ordered the construction of thousands of cryostasis pods and the giant underground space to house them. There, the brightest Vagrosian minds could sleep, awaiting the Scion's return. And so they had, until the cryostasis could no longer support their bodies. Minds reduced to data, they waited for their Scion inside his throne."
