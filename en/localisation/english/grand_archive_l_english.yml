The will of the hunter, sharp and cold as starlight...\n\nThis civilization has a primal connection to the wild.

 START_SCREEN_PRIMAL_CALLING: "Despite rapid technological progress, we remain bound to the wild creatures of our world. Unwavering companions throughout our evolution, they are as much our teachers as we are their stewards. We do not take from them more than they can afford to give, and their sacrifices are venerated.\n\nIn the untamed expanse of space, we may well discover other wild things. If so, we will treat them with the same respect as the creatures of our world. They will learn their place as we learn ours, so that together we may grow stronger.\n\nCalled to the stars, a primal desire burns within us. Whatever is out there, we will meet it with conviction."

 # First Contacts
 first_contact_critters.15.desc.primal_calling: "Of note, there is a matriarchal hierarchy at the center of each §HTiyanki§! pod, with a singular cow leading the group at any one time.

 first_contact_critters.35.desc.primal_calling: "These creatures seem to communicate with one another via chromatic changes in refracted light.

Changes in color can be used to indicate social status, aggression, and even fertility conditions."
 grand_archive.2005.desc.primal_calling: "These parasitic creatures lack the natural ability to reproduce and must rely on the acquisition of planet-borne hosts. Sufficient organic matter must be harvested from inhabited planets for the §H"Voidworms"§! to produce a crucial hormone within their mating trios, known as "troikas". As hermaphroditic creatures, the selection of partners is determined primarily by complementary physical traits and comparable size."
 grand_archive.2900.desc.primal_calling: "We believe that the creatures select their asteroids based on mineral composition as well as size. While the first specimen we encountered possesses a biological preference for [GetCommonMineral], it is likely each individual develops this adaptation over time based on their current environment.

[random_shipyard.leader.GetHeSheCap] was carrying out routine repairs in the fight against the Voidworms when [random_shipyard.leader.GetHeShe] came up with an idea for a new component that would increase the hardiness of our vessels.

We inserted it into the main hatch of the megastructure.\n\nThe chart activated, internally tracing a singular beam of light to each star along our journey. Ancient machinery groaned to life, and we were soon inside.\n\nIncredible treasures looted from a thousand worlds line the floor and walls in abundance. Delicate statues are juxtaposed against assault weapons forged in precious metals. Fine jewelry hangs from the extremities of antique fossils and complex devices are piled up in an orderless heap.\n\nMetallic footsteps ring out from the central walkway. Arms raised in surrender, a fluid-filled humanoid machine approaches us. Its voice circuits crackle into activation:\n\n§L"So... you found my chart after all. Aren't you clever?"§!"

Former "Pirate Queen of the Galaxy" and current occupant of this cold pile of bolts.\n\n§HThe machine pauses for a moment, taking in our forms.§!\n\nIt's been a long time since I last saw your species.

Next thing I know, you've opened the door and we're having this conversation. Feels like only yesterday I laid down to sleep..."
 grand_archive.8570.b: "Where did you get all of this treasure?"
 grand_archive.8570.b.reply: "Stole it, mostly. Or traded it for other ill-gotten goods. I ripped off every major player in the galaxy once upon a time. Cargo ships, Colossus weapons; you name it, I've hijacked it. My logic was that if I could take something so easily from you, you didn't care enough to deserve it.\n\nThings would sometimes get... messy. You saw what happened to the Ytterites. That one was an eye-opener.\n\nIt's all fun and games until it's not any more..."

 grand_archive.8570.c.reply: "Would you believe me if I said I was lonely?\n\n§HThe machine's vocal circuits crackled with what might have been laughter.§!\n\nI had all of this treasure, but for what? What does it get me in the end? I realized it wasn't riches that I wanted; it was a legacy. But, you can't steal a legacy - so how do you create one?\n\nWell, this was my shot at it. I found a few of the most promising primitive species and seeded their worlds with treasure - and the map of course. Whoever pieced together my chart first would pass the test and be worthy of inheriting my life's work. So... here we are.\n\nMaybe your kind can do what I could not, and put all of this to good use."
 grand_archive.8570.d: "Why give away everything?"
 grand_archive.8570.d.reply: "I've told you, I'm passing on the torch. I'm not good at spending money, only taking it.\n\nI couldn't give it away to just anyone, though. They had to be clever enough to reach this place; a crew I could be proud of. One I could share my story with..."

 grand_archive.8570.e.reply: "Well, since you asked...\n\n§HThe machine activates a console, and a series of digital recordings are projected across the wall.§!\n\nThis entire vault is my biography. I paid a great deal to a team of authors to record every moment of my life that could be remembered. They did a fair job of it, I think.\n\n§HThe images shift to a cockpit image of a pirate crew, the biological form of Captain Ness in command. A short crackle escapes the machine's voice circuits; it has the weight of a sigh.§!\n\nI was once the most feared pirate in the galaxy. I've bankrupted mega-corporations, ransomed planets, and reduced entire empires to rubble. Anyone foolish enough to oppose me got a blade in their [root.GetSpeciesOrganName] or were sold off for a bounty. My own bounty? Astronomical."
 grand_archive.8570.f: "Please continue."
 grand_archive.8570.f.reply: "§HDigital recordings of various hold-ups, heists, and daring escapes, all set to heroic music are projected.§!\n\nAt first, I picked my targets carefully and found some justification as to why they deserved it. Each job was more exciting than the last. It was a cycle: planning, demonizing, robbing, then celebrating. The problem was that looking for "bad" targets was too time-consuming. I needed to expand my horizons.\n\nEventually, if there was something I wanted, I'd just take it. I enjoyed watching the numbers go up; the price of my bounty and the value of my hoard. I was leaving my mark on the world and I'd never be forgotten. Everything else was unimportant."
 grand_archive.8570.g: "What changed?"
 grand_archive.8570.g.reply: "§HThe Ytterite homeworld is displayed in ruin.§!\n\nThen the Yterrite incident happened... You saw it, right? I still remember the cries on the radio as the last of their lives were snuffed out. Things went too far. It was time for a change.\n\nThere was a pattern I discovered over my career: History fades, lessons are forgotten, and someone new takes your place. I simply wanted to be able to pick who came after me.\n\nThat's you. You [root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] passed the test. What happens next is up to you."

Unfortunately, this significant biological modification will mean they are no longer able to engulf enemy fleets."

 grand_archive.10030.desc: "Our experimental mutation project on §YCrystalline Entities§! is complete, and has yielded some interesting results: §Y$tech_unique_mutation_crystalline_entity$§!\n\nWith this modification to their crystalline genetics, each creature is capable of splitting into two independent organisms in the event of severe trauma. This should drastically improve their combat capabilities."

This demands a small amount of energy to maintain, but vastly improves their growth rate near the brightest stars."

 space_amoeba_desc: "Space Amoeba are lone predators, aggressive towards anything they encounter. Supported by partially-formed spawn known as "flagella", these creatures are adept at chasing down their prey."
 tiyanki_desc: "Tiyanki, also known as "Space Whales", are typically docile creatures that graze on atmospheric gasses. These creatures are extremely collaborative and pods in the wild are organized under a strict hierarchy."
 voidworm_desc: "Voidworms are parasitic organisms that must deposit spores on inhabited worlds with suitable biomass in order to reproduce. Mature individuals form mating trios, known as "Troikas", and will construct nests near black holes to shelter and raise their young."
 cutholoid_desc: "Cutholoids are massive organisms that inhabit asteroids in order to provide suitable protection for their otherwise soft bodies. This creature swallows its prey whole, using radioactive digestive fluid to slowly consume its prey."
 crystalline_entity_desc: "Crystalline Entities are a unique form of silicate-animate beings that can freely propel themselves through space. The hue of each entity varies not due to age, but as a reflection of their latent internal charge."
