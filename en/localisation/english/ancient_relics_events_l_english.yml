 crisis.252.desc:0 "In the recent fleet engagement against the Prethoryn in the [battle_system.GetName] system, our forces managed to capture some sort of egg that was being transported by one of their Queens. The egg hatched shortly afterwards, and a §HBrood-Queen§! emerged.\n\nThrough the use of neural transmitters, our scientists have managed to pacify the creature. It will now obey our commands as if they had been issued by the Prethoryn hive mind itself. We could potentially use this Queen to grow a small Prethoryn brood of our own."

 crisis.1250.desc:0 "When the swirling energies left behind after the destruction of the last dimensional portal finally dissipated, our forces found a weakened extradimensional drifting nearby. The creature was captured and interrogated.\n\nIt is apparently one of their "§HWarlocks§!" - a powerful extradimensional even by their standards, responsible for maintaining the portal's link between our reality and theirs.

 site_command_center:0 "Asteroid Blast Door"
 site_command_center_intro:0 "A collision with a smaller asteroid has revealed a small blast door or airlock extending slightly from the surface of [From.Planet.GetName]. It appears to be thousands of years old, and had previously been concealed by rocks and dust.\n\nFor unknown reasons, scans cannot penetrate the asteroid's interior and the blast door is impervious to conventional cutting tools. To learn what is behind this door, a team would likely have to dig their way towards the center of the asteroid from another direction."
 ancrel.6005.name:0 "Drilling a Hole"
 ancrel.6005.desc:0 "A very large structure of some kind occupies most of the interior of asteroid [From.Planet.GetName]. The blast door which once served as this structure's only entrance still can't be opened, but a passage has been dug from the other side of the asteroid.\n\nDrills have so far been unable to penetrate the thick outer walls of the structure, but this method still seems to afford the best chance of gaining access. Despite their age, the blast doors have proven nearly invulnerable."
 ancrel.6010.name:0 "Entrance"
 ancrel.6010.desc:0 "A hole has finally been drilled through the outer walls of structure inside [From.Planet.GetName]. The interior is a vast command center or bunker of some sort, littered with the decayed remains of thousands of dead aliens.\n\nSifting through all this to gain a clearer picture of what exactly was going on inside this asteroid will take considerable time."
 ancrel.6015.name:0 "Command Center"
 ancrel.6015.desc:0 "This asteroid once served as the hidden capital of a relatively large interstellar empire that dominated this section of the galaxy several thousand years ago. From this fortified command center, the ruling elite along with thousands of military and civilian officials administered the empire while safe from the violent reprisals their harsh policies often inspired.\n\nContact with the rest of their empire seems to have been handled exclusively through encrypted subspace transmissions and a single freighter which made periodic visits to resupply the base and transfer personnel."
 ancrel.6020.name:0 "The Final Days"
 ancrel.6020.desc:0 "From what can be pieced together, it appears that the resupply freighter collided with the asteroid due to a thruster malfunction. The resulting explosion damaged the blast doors and destroyed the asteroid's subspace transmitter, permanently severing all contact with the outside world.\n\nTrapped and with no hope of rescue, the asteroid's inhabitants slowly succumbed to starvation or suicide. The last logs of their single surviving subspace receiver confirm that their empire, suddenly bereft of its capital, descended into civil war and anarchy."

 site_hunting_ground:0 "Fossilized Remains"
 site_hunting_ground_intro:0 "Fossilized remains from several different species that do not appear to have been indigenous to [From.Planet.GetName] have been found in a large and secluded valley on the planet. They all date from roughly the same time period, within the span of a few centuries some 3.6 million years ago.\n\nEach of these species seems to have evolved in its own unique biosphere, and all appear to have been sapient. Strangely, every fossilized individual found so far shows signs of having met a violent end."
 ancrel.6050.name:0 "More Remains"
 ancrel.6050.desc:0 "Archaeologists have unearthed more and more fossilized remains in the valley, and the count is now up to 26 distinct sapient species, none of them native to [From.Planet.GetName]. Those fossils that have been sufficiently preserved to determine a cause of death all point towards physical trauma inflicted by blades, spears, or arrows. Not a single specimen appears to have been felled by the equivalent of modern projectile or energy weapons.\n\nThe ruins of a small structure of some sort have been found near the entrance of the valley. It appears to originate from the same time period as the fossils. Perhaps it will shed some light on things."
 ancrel.6055.name:0 "The Lodge"
 ancrel.6055.desc:0 "The excavation of the ancient structure found near the valley's entrance is proceeding according to plan. Many artifacts have been discovered, most of which seem to be variations of hunting weapons and trophies. A partially translated sign, which appears to denote the name of the structure, reads:\n\n§H"VALLEY OF MAK'VAEHL - HUNTING LODGE PRIMUS"§!"
 ancrel.6060.name:0 "The Retarax Domain"
 ancrel.6060.desc:0 "Continued excavations near the hunting lodge have provided more details. [From.Planet.GetName] - and the Valley of Mak'vaehl, specifically - served as a hunting reserve for the ruling warrior class of an interstellar polity known as the §HRetarax Domain§!.\n\nThe Retarax, a predatory avian species, periodically collected random individuals from the many subjugated alien civilizations under their rule. These aliens were then hunted down and killed in the wilderness of Mak'vaehl, according to the rituals that governed Retarax society. This tradition lasted several centuries, until the Domain eventually succumbed to an undefined outside threat."
 ancrel.6065.name:0 "The Huntress"
 ancrel.6065.desc:0 "Archaeologists excavating the hunting lodge have stumbled upon several references to a legendary Retarax warrior known only as §H"The Huntress."§! She was apparently their most efficient killer, renowned throughout the Domain for having personally butchered thousands of aliens at Mak'vaehl.\n\nIt is unclear whether this is based on fact or fiction, but according to Retarax legend the Huntress was killed somewhere inside the valley when she was outwitted by the alien prey she was pursuing. She was supposedly wielding the fabled §H"Blade of the Huntress"§! at the time."
 ancrel.6070.name:0 "The Blade of the Huntress"
 ancrel.6070.desc:0 "After painstakingly combing through the Valley of Mak'vaehl for any trace of the legendary Huntress, archaeologists were finally able to pinpoint her last resting place. Her fossilized skeleton was found locked in battle with the remains of a large horned arthropoid, with her claws still clasping the hilt of a perfectly preserved sword.\n\nThis must be the §HBlade of the Huntress§!. The weapon is composed of an unknown material and is sharp enough to cut straight through our strongest armor."

 ancrel.6099.name:0 "Chameleon Field Exposed"
 ancrel.6099.desc:0 "A chameleon energy field of some sort concealing an ancient structure was recently exposed on the surface of §H[tomb_planet.GetName]§!, a lifeless [tomb_planet.GetPlanetMoon] inside our space. Only a chance asteroid impact which was deflected off the field while the [tomb_planet.GetPlanetMoon] was being monitored by a passing freighter revealed its existence."
 ancrel.6099.a:0 "This should be investigated."
 site_zarqlan:0 "Ancient Tomb"
 site_zarqlan_intro:0 "A chameleon energy field of some sort concealed an ancient structure on the surface of this planet. Only a chance asteroid impact which was deflected off the field while it was being monitored revealed its existence.\n\nWith the field deactivated, archaeologists will now have access to the large and forbidding building complex that was hidden beneath it."
 ancrel.6100.name:0 "The Mausoleum"
 ancrel.6100.desc:0 "The structure appears to be a gigantic mausoleum or necropolis, dating back several million years. There are no obvious signs of previous looters, so the structure may have been left untouched since the chameleon field was erected.\n\nThe structure's First Chamber is accessible, but an impenetrable door blocks any further progress. Large alien glyphs, as yet untranslated, have been carved into the wall above the door."
 ancrel.6105.name:0 "The First Chamber"
 ancrel.6105.desc:0 "The alien glyphs above the door have been translated as follows:\n\n§H"I am ZARQLAN, the Guardian of MOZ-TARB, the Prophet of ZVA. In a galaxy awash with spite and hatred, I have chosen to seclude myself here. Proceed, if ye be worthy."§!\n\nAfter combing through the First Chamber for anything of interest, archaeologists discovered a tiny concealed wall panel. When pressed, the ancient door rumbled open. The Second Chamber can now be accessed."
 ancrel.6110.name:0 "The Second Chamber"
 ancrel.6110.desc:0 "The Second Chamber is unremarkable, aside from another set of alien glyphs above a closed door. They read:\n\n§H"Petty kings issued edicts in my name. Empires waged war in my honor. Fools sang my praises. I would have none of it."§!\n\nNo secret wall panel has yet been found that would provide access to the Third Chamber."
 ancrel.6115.name:0 "The Third Chamber"
 ancrel.6115.desc:0 "After a long and tiring search, a secret lever hidden under the floor was found which provided access to the Fourth Chamber. As before, alien glyphs adorned the wall above yet another door:\n\n§H"Those who wish to parlay with ZARQLAN must first find their way. There is, in each chamber, a hidden key that must be turned to proceed. The purpose of these challenges will soon be revealed."§!"
 ancrel.6120.name:0 "The Fourth Chamber"
 ancrel.6120.desc:0 "This time the lever was concealed in the roof. The Fifth Chamber has more alien writing:\n\n§H"There is none. The challenges are as meaningless as these words. That is my lesson. I am ZARQLAN, the pawn. Swept along by the currents of history against my will. Proceed and an audience shall be yours, should one still be of interest."§!\n\nThe next chamber is likely to be the last."
 ancrel.6125.name:0 "The Final Chamber"
 ancrel.6125.desc:0 "After a grueling search, the last "key" was discovered in the form of a minuscule button hidden in one of the carved alien glyphs. In the last chamber, a gigantic throne holds the slumped and motionless form of a large humanoid figure. A horrible smell hints at the decayed state of the being's body. Some glyphs at the bottom of the throne read simply: §H"ZARQLAN, AT YOUR SERVICE"§!\n\nThe body is too far gone to be moved, but the head is surprisingly well-preserved given its age. Not wanting to leave empty handed, some archaeologists use a laser cutter to remove the head."
 ancrel.6130.desc:0 "It... it is true then. You have found the legendary tomb of Zarqlan. When the Augurs told me, I did not believe them, but the evidence is irrefutable. I understand that you have the Prophet's head in your possession?\n\nThen as was foretold, the chosen of the great Zarqlan have at last been revealed. As would have been Zarqlan's wish, any unsettled holy worlds near our space are yours to do with as you wish.

 ancrel.6150.desc:0 "As confirmed by its recent survey, §H[From.GetName]§! is surrounded by an incredibly strong energy field that deflects all attempts to scan it. The field appears to be generated from the planet's nearby moon."
 ancrel.6151.desc:0 "§H[From.GetName]§! is emitting an impenetrable energy barrier that surrounds the planet it orbits. The exact source of the barrier is difficult to pinpoint, but it appears to be coming from somewhere deep beneath the moon's barren surface.\n\nAncient ruins of what must have been a large base of some sort, possibly of a military nature, can be found inside one of the moon's largest craters. It may hold some answers."

 site_minigalaxy_1:0 "Moon Base"
 site_minigalaxy_1_intro:0 "Ruins of a large base complex of some kind can be found inside a large crater on this moon. It must have been abandoned thousands of years ago. The energy barrier that encompasses the nearby planet appears to originate from a source directly beneath this ancient base."
 ancrel.6155.name:0 "The Armistice Initiative"
 ancrel.6155.desc:0 "Continued excavations of the ruins on §H[From.Planet.GetName]§! have revealed that the abandoned base was once a massive military installation built by the "§HArmistice Initiative§!." They were a semi-permanent alliance of at least five large and very advanced interstellar powers active in this galactic region some 75,000 years ago.\n\nThe exact nature of this alliance is unknown, but it appears to have been committed to bringing an immediate end to several long-running galactic wars. Large military contingents from each Initiative member were stationed at the base on this moon."
 ancrel.6160.name:0 "Belligerent Party C"
 ancrel.6160.desc:0 "The shielded planet in this system was the capital of one of the warring empires the Armistice Initiative was formed to stop. This empire's name is still unknown - they are referred to simply as "§HBelligerent Party C§!" in all Initiative records recovered so far.\n\nApparently, the Armistice Initiative sought to make an example of Belligerent Party C. After invading their space and winning several hard-fought battles, the Initiative permanently imprisoned the homeworld of Party C behind an energy shield. A military base was established on the nearby moon to maintain the shield and act as a response force in the unlikely event of containment failure."
 ancrel.6165.name:0 "The Shield Generator"
 ancrel.6165.desc:0 "The Initiative moon base was kept operational for several centuries, but with no signs of containment failure the forces were gradually scaled back. Shifting alliances and infighting between the various Initiative members eventually left the base completely deserted.\n\nAutomated systems were left in place to maintain the shield surrounding Party C's homeworld, and they have, incredibly, remained functional up until now. Alas, a critical power cable was severed when our archaeologists dug their way into the subterranean generator chamber. After 75,000 years of continuous operation, the shield is no more."

 site_minigalaxy_2:0 "Abandoned Ecumenopolis"
 site_minigalaxy_2_intro:0 "This ancient Relic World was imprisoned behind an impenetrable energy barrier for roughly 75,000 years. It must once have been a vibrant ecumenopolis home to hundreds of billions of individuals, but the streets and buildings are deserted now. None of the planet's original inhabitants remain."
 ancrel.6170.name:0 "Disappearance"
 ancrel.6170.desc:0 "The disappearance of this planet's original population remains a mystery. Once the shield went up and they were isolated from the rest of their interstellar empire, they likely faced mass famine and civil unrest as they struggled to support their capital's massive population with what limited resources they had.\n\nYet there are no signs that they demolished parts of their city planet to cultivate the land. Nothing suggests that any significant fighting took place after the shield went up, and there are no remains, fossilized or otherwise, of the inhabitants. It's like they simply vanished into thin air."
 ancrel.6175.name:0 "Evacuation Day"

 ancrel.6180.desc:0 "The planet was clearly abandoned after this "Evacuation Day" concluded, but how? There is no evidence that the planet's energy barrier ever went down.\n\nClues have been discovered that indicate the pursuit of some sort of massive research project that predates the shield. Resources and science staff were diverted to this project in increasing numbers, and efforts appear to have greatly intensified after the shield went up."
 ancrel.6185.name:0 "Miniaturized Galaxy"
 ancrel.6185.desc:0 "After intense search efforts, we have discovered where the inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName] went. Deep inside a tall fortified structure near the planet's northern pole, we found a relic that our archaeologists are convinced holds an actual miniaturized galaxy.\n\nSomehow, after creating this galaxy, the inhabitants of the Relic World all relocated there and then sealed it in this container with some kind of impervious subspace field. While we can't interfere with the galaxy itself, our scientists assure us that we can study it."

 ancrel.6200.name:0 "Pleasure Palace"
 ancrel.6200.desc:0 "The present dark and lifeless interior of the space station almost succeeds in hiding the fact that it must have been designed as some kind of luxurious pleasure palace. There are seemingly endless rows of rusty slot machines, hundreds of decrepit bars and restaurants, and amidst it all, thousands of bodies.\n\nDead, partially mummified aliens of at least a dozen different species can be found everywhere, but most of the bodies are clustered around the empty escape pod bays."
 ancrel.6205.name:0 "The Star Petal"
 ancrel.6205.desc:0 "This derelict station was once known as the "§HStar Petal§!" and it was apparently a celebrated luxury resort in this corner of the galaxy nearly a thousand years ago. A small fleet of tugs would drag the station to a new exotic location each year, but [From.Planet.GetName] appears to have been its last.\n\nFor unclear reasons, the station was pulled into the gas giant's atmosphere where it suffered critical damage."
 ancrel.6210.name:0 "The Final Days"
 ancrel.6210.desc:0 "The archaeologists working on the Star Petal have gathered sufficient clues and evidence to paint a reasonably clear picture of the station's final days. A stray asteroid impacted the station, knocking it into an orbit that would soon plunge it into [From.Planet.GetName]'s atmosphere.\n\nStation-keeping thrusters could not compensate, and the command staff soon issued an evacuation order. Unfortunately, the station only had enough escape pods to evacuate a fraction of its passengers and mass panic soon erupted. Those who were not trampled to death perished when the station's environmental systems failed as it drifted deeper into the gas giant."

In some way we cannot fully describe, the crystal seems to have wanted to be found, and is trying to communicate with us. Perhaps with further study, communication will be possible?"
 ancrel.3.a:0 "Probe the Crystal"
 ancrel.4.desc:1 "After a great deal of trial and error, a breakthrough has been made. The crystal is some kind of Psionic Archive, but its records are fragmented.\n\nWhat we know is that this was a colony of §HThe Zroni§!: a psionically gifted race who discovered a dimension which came to be known as "The Shroud". Once the Zroni population reached critical mass, it seems that their collective unconscious minds began to make contact with the proto-shroud in dreams, leading to mass lucid dreaming. The phenomenon was studied, and the Zroni discovered how to psionically project themselves into the Shroud - at which point they also found that they could manipulate the very fabric of reality, using their psionic powers.\n\nIt wasn't long before the Zroni discovered they could physically enter the Shroud and live like gods, transforming the dimension to suit their whims...\n\nThe Archive's records end there, with no information on what happened to the inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName]. But while there are no answers here, we have learned of another Zroni colony which may contain a more complete Archive..."
 ancrel.5.desc:0 "[From.Planet.GetName] contains the ruins of another abandoned Zroni colony. The first step to solving this mystery is to find- and make contact with this world's Psionic Archive."
 ancrel.6.desc:1 "It was much easier to establish contact with the crystal this time around, using protocols we established with the previous one. Again its records are fragmented, but we have learned that another advantage of being able to enter the Shroud was that the Shroud touches all parts of the physical galaxy - perhaps all parts of the universe - simultaneously.\n\nIf one can enter the Shroud, it is possible to exit it at any known location. This ability to "Psionically jump" between physical locations allowed the Zroni to spread to all corners of the galaxy. Because they spent most of their time within the Shroud, the Zroni established relatively few permanent colonies. Those they did set up were mostly located near to their homeworld.\n\nThis crystal has given us the location of another colony."
 ancrel.7.desc:1 "Finding and communicating with the Psionic Archives has become much easier now. Contact can be made as soon as our expedition lands, at which point we can access more detailed records and concepts. From what we have learned here, some things are too good to be true - and so it was with the godhood granted to the Zroni by the Shroud.\n\nThe energy required to power the vast changes in the Shroud's composition had to come from somewhere, and for them it originated from the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. As the Zroni made their changes within the Shroud, so the singularity expanded: consuming the mass of the galactic center and converting it into energy which was then siphoned into the Shroud. This discovery shook the Zroni: debate turn to argument; arguments led to division; division turned to civil war between their two main factions."
 ancrel.8.desc:1 "Further details of the Zroni civil war factions have been extracted from the crystal. One faction - which came to be known as "The Divine" - felt that the fate of the physical galaxy was of no concern to the Zroni, who could continue their omnipotent existence in the Shroud until the entire galaxy was consumed in some unimaginably far off future. Even then, there are other galaxies, perhaps even other universes which could conceivably be consumed.\n\nThe other faction, "The Saviors", were aghast at this; the Zroni should not destroy the galaxy to live as parasitic gods! Even outside of the Shroud, their Psionic abilities guaranteed them a utopian existence.\n\nThe location of another Zroni colony has also been discovered."
 ancrel.9.desc:1 "It was strangely difficult to locate the Archive on [From.Planet.GetName] - but once we did locate it, it was easy to see why it had been so elusive: the crystal has been shattered, and contains no records that we can access. However, a faint signal suggests that there may be something else to find here."
 ancrel.9.a:0 "Continue searching."
 ancrel.10.desc:1 "A much smaller psionic crystal has been located in some kind of laboratory. The Zroni who recorded their findings within were extremely frustrated: their research had been ridiculed by their peers, and was largely discredited. They believed that the Zroni were no longer the only entities in the Shroud, and that the collective fears and desires of their entire race were coalescing into distinct, sapient entities.\n\nDesiring to grow stronger, these entities had begun to subtly influence the emotions and thoughts of suitable Zroni: slowly causing their behaviors to become more extreme. This may have directly caused the Zroni civil war.\n\nWe also discovered a location reference for one of the Zroni's major colonies."
 ancrel.11.desc:1 "Unlike the previous Zroni worlds, [From.Planet.GetName] was clearly a major colony, with several cities of varying size covering the surface. However, like the others it now sits empty, showing no signs of disaster or death; the fate of its population is unknown. Several Archive crystals have been detected, and will need to be investigated."
 ancrel.12.desc:1 "Most of the accessible records focus on the course of the war. Our working theory is that the mood of the population influences the "strength" of the record about a subject, meaning the most thought-about issues are recorded with greater prominence. Unsurprisingly, the course of the war was on everyone's mind.\n\nThe majority of the Zroni sided with the Saviors, but while they had an advantage in numbers they bore one significant disadvantage: heedless of their effects on the galaxy, the Divine were free to use their full Psionic might; meanwhile the Saviors were limited to whatever power could be drawn from their own bodies.\n\nAt first the war seemed hopeless, but eventually a hero amongst the Saviors would make a terrible - yet vital - discovery."
 ancrel.12.a:0 "Investigate the Discovery"
 ancrel.13.desc:0 "The crystal tells us how a rogue Zroni researcher - working on a theory which his peers refused to believe - turned his power inwards, consuming his own body in a contained Psionic chain-reaction. Following his last instructions, the dusty residue of his supreme sacrifice was tested and confirmed to be an incredibly potent source of Psionic energy. It was essentially the sum total Psionic potential of his life, rendered instantly usable by another Psion.\n\nThe crystal also contains the location of the Zroni homeworld."
 ancrel.13.a:0 "The Dust... is the Zroni!"
 ancrel.15.desc:1 "Zron is wracked by storms of psionic energy, and appears to only be partially in phase with the rest of the universe. Whatever calamity befell the Zroni seems to have originated here.\n\nLike all the previous colonies, it is devoid of Zroni but is teeming with crystalline signals. Given this much signal noise - on top of the strange atmospheric conditions - it may take some time for us to locate any useful information."
 ancrel.16.desc:1 "We have found- and communicated with several crystals, including one from the outcast Shroud-entity researchers. With these, we are learning more about the Zroni's war.\n\nUsing the Zro dust required great sacrifice from the Saviors, but with it they were able to turn the tide of their war against the Divine. As their defeat loomed, the ever-increasing rage and fear of the Divine spawned new and terrible entities within the Shroud. The feedback loop grew, pushing the Divine into the depths of madness. They were driven to ever-worsening atrocities, urging the Saviors to end the war at any cost."
 ancrel.16.a:1 "Continue..."
 ancrel.17.desc:1 "As we communicate with more crystals, more details emerge. On the brink of defeat, the Divine decided upon their ultimate plan: the end of the cycle. The growth of the black hole galactic core would be accelerated to consume the galaxy as soon as possible.\n\nAt worst, the Saviors - and every other species in the galaxy - would be destroyed, leaving the Divine to rule the shroud for a vast but finite time. It was, however, possible that the expansion would become self-sustaining, consuming not just the galaxy but the universe itself: providing a source of energy which may not be infinite, but would at least come close enough amount to make no practical difference."
 ancrel.18.desc:0 "We have learned the fate of the Zroni: when the Saviors learned of the Divine's plan, they knew there was only one possible counter to the Divine's almost-impenetrable defenses in the Shroud. Faced with annihilation, they chose to sacrifice their entire population save for one Zroni. This last remaining Savior used the psionic residue of an entire species to destroy every Zroni - and thus every Divine - in existence, ending the threat for all time.\n\nThe Zroni were wiped out almost without a trace, save for a small amount of unconsumed dust."
 ancrel.18.a:0 "Inconceivable!"
 ancrel.19.desc:1 "As our expedition made ready to leave, one of the psionic crystals suddenly re-established contact. It has indicated that it could prove useful to us, should we decide to bring it with us.

 ancrel.23.desc:1 "Once we found an entrance to the data center and forced passage through the wreckage, it was a surprisingly easy task to reactivate- and interface with the computer systems. Self-repairing circuits and learning algorithms quickly came online to restore limited functionality, and communicate with our own computers.\n\nThe cause for this burst of activity quickly became clear: [From.Planet.GetName] was once the capital of a machine empire known as §H"The Omnicodex."§! Named for their driving purpose, the Omni were a hybrid of robots and cyborgs who had attempted to assimilate samples of all biological life in the galaxy, in order to prevent their extinction in the face of unknown galactic calamity.\n\nFrom the records which survive, we gather that this course of action was not popular amongst the other galactic powers of their era; the Omni were eventually defeated in a joint campaign conducted by several of these empires.\n\nBefore their downfall, the Omni managed to sample a great deal of races, and much work was put into developing a device capable of re-creating them if the need should ever arise. This device - The Omnicodex proper - is apparently stored somewhere nearby."
 ancrel.24.desc:0 "The Omnicodex has been unearthed. This unique device contains the genetic sequence of every race that the Omni were able to sample, and can re-create them using only basic elements as raw materials. Unfortunately, it seems the Omni did not have time to perfect it before meeting their annihilation, so there is no means of selecting which of the many sampled races would be created in any given activation of the device."

Kilometers down, it opens into a massive, perfectly spherical chamber. Floating in a suspension field at the very center is an inscrutable alien device: a semi-opaque, amber-tinted cube with intricate alien patterns inscribed on all six sides. Touching the inscriptions causes rhythmic pulses of light to be emitted from the cube.\n\nThere is no trace of any known language, code, or mathematical equation in the chamber or on the puzzle box itself, but it is fairly safe to assume that the box is a riddle of some kind."

This was not immediately apparent because the viewpoint from which the constellations were depicted originates, ominously, from outside our own galaxy. Once that discovery had been made, unlocking the box was easy. It is, in fact, a map.\n\nOnce the puzzle box was solved, it lit up to reveal a holographic display of a nearby star system, focusing on a particular location in the outer belt. Observations of that point revealed an unusually dense cluster of rocky debris, some of it continental in size. Upon inspection it turned out to be the remaining fragments of an entire planet that was somehow destroyed many eons ago.\n\nWhatever was there, and whatever inspired the construction of this grand edifice pointing the way, is long gone."

There was much time-consuming backtracking, but in the end, it was unlocked.\n\nAs the last pattern clicked into place, the puzzle box exploded into millions of tiny points of light. The lights danced madly in the air for a few moments, before coalescing to create words in some unknown language. Oddly, all witnesses to this event seemed to instinctively understand the message without knowing the words. For a few seconds, before flickering out forever, it read: §HYou have passed the Trial.

It roamed with impunity, scouring the surface clean of all organic matter it touched. The trenches were dug out by the indigenous population of diminutive mustelid-like humanoids, in order to either escape the snail's onslaught, or to try to attack its vulnerable underbelly.

As it turns out, the poetic, metaphorical nature of the native language - interpreted as being of religious expression - was in fact just the normal way this species communicated.\n\nThe nature of the oncoming menace is still a mystery, but from the looks of it, whatever it was seems to have arrived before the Titan was fully operational.

All the strange organic formations on the planet are actually connected in a single, vast coral reef. This coral, as it turned out, is partly aware, although with an utterly alien mindset compared to our conception of sentient life. Through pheromones excreted in the water, it has more or less enslaved the rest of all the organisms in the sea, controlling their behavior and reproduction cycles to fit its own needs.\n\nIt seems to be completely benign, but it is a puppet master nonetheless.

Beneath the thick carpet of alien coral is a fossilized extinction layer of the entire previous ecosystem of this world. It seems the coral, once introduced, gradually choked out all the native life and replaced it with an ecosystem tailored specifically for itself.\n\nThere are two main theories as to why this might have been done: either the artificial coral was introduced for benign reasons, and then it massively out-competed the local wildlife in an unexpected way, or it was deliberately constructed to be some sort of terrifying biological weapon to cleanse ocean worlds of native life."

They vary slightly in size, but not in how they are laid out. The second discovery was even more astonishing: the islands aren't parts of the planet crust - they actually float! Their lower levels are filled with pockets of gas, which combined with the fairly brittle and porous island rock makes then buoyant."

 ancrel.9370.desc:1 "The answer to the mystery of the floating islands was not found in the field of geology, but in biology. The islands are in fact enormous fossilized jellyfish creatures. Millions of years ago an ice age froze them all to death, after which their carcasses were fossilized into the islands seen bobbing around in the water today. Ages of debris accretion gave their exposed surface the look of natural islands, but beneath that they are entirely organic."

And they aren't dead, either: the seemingly fossilized state is just a natural part of their life cycle.

The sediment contains microscopic polyps that eventually germinate in the water until they enter the next stage of their life cycle."

 endless_expanse_digsite_desc:0 "At first sight there is only snow and ice on [From.Planet.GetName]. Vast expanses of impenetrable white, glass lakes and jagged turquoise glaciers against fiery orange skies torn open like a wound, pouring red into the seas as [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName]'s stars set. If the world had an end this would be it. Here the seas lie still and the snow untouched. The only sounds are the thunder of the ice calving and the wind howling across the plains.\n\nYet, [From.Planet.GetName] was once someone's home. In the midst of a wide barren field the black metal framework of a steeple protrudes from the white masses. What forgotten secrets could be buried beneath the snow?"
 ancrel.4040.name:0 "Church of the Endless Expanse"
 ancrel.4040.desc:0 "The archaeological team has laid bare the remains of a modest temple. Delicately carved from an organic alien material the exterior was once brightly colored but has faded to a dull gray. A fully operational holographic priest still presides over the church. While the temple was in use she took confessions from wayfaring penitents offering healing, reconciliation and sanctuary to this otherwise inhospitable nook of the universe.\n\nUnusual mechanical confessional chairs akin to torture devices have led the archaeologists to believe there may be more to the temple than meets the eye."
 ancrel.4041.name:0 "Oblivion"
 ancrel.4041.desc:0 "Hidden under the floor tiles in the sacristy, the archaeologists have discovered a secret crypt where the walls are lined with rows upon rows of tiny blue digital orbs, their circuitry glittering in the dark. Each orb contains the memory of a single confession and can be plugged into a cryptic looking machine at the center of the room to reveal its contents.\n\nThose who confessed their sins were blessed with oblivion, the memories of their deeds extracted by the confessional chairs and stored within the digital orbs."
 ancrel.4041.a:0 "How practical."

 ancrel.4041.c:0 "Sacrilege! The bliss of ignorance is not for sinners."
 ancrel.4042.name:0 "Sin"
 ancrel.4042.desc:0 "Sin is unoriginal. The memory orbs contain countless accounts of tedious little transgressions; infidelity, bearing sacrilegious garb, exposing your flappers, adorning your feelers, ingesting your neighbor's pet, child or spouse... The deeds of one penitent alone stand out - those of the priest herself...\n\nThe holo-priest, as it turns out, is a virtual representation of the church's founder, Illuminate Saariah. She appears to have suffered from severe memory loss and was haunted by the conviction that she had committed a heinous act in the past. The tiny molluscoid priest extracted and stored over a hundred of her own confessions in an attempt to figure out what she had done."
 ancrel.4047.name:0 "Forgotten But Not Forgiven"
 ancrel.4047.desc:0 "Illuminate Saariah's work station is littered with obsessive scribbles about a place called Ix Belèn and the horrors she fears transpired there. Judging from her journal she had intermittent moments of clarity followed by complete memory loss. She writes that if she did not recognize her own handwriting she would have thought they were the ramblings of a madwoman. It seems likely that her deteriorating mental health was a side-effect of repeated memory extraction but without a body it is impossible to say.\n\nPiecing together a coherent course of events from her many fragmented confessions has proven as hopeless for the archaeologists as it was for her, but they have uncovered what could be the coordinates to Ix Belèn from one of her many memory orbs."

 endless_expanse_digsite_2_desc:0 "Shrouded within [From.Planet.GetName]'s gaseous atmosphere is the dark looming form of an enormous habitat - the Ix Belèn Residence. Previously a bustling space city where the residents enjoyed a pampered lifestyle with a multitude of comforts made available through technology, the habitat is now a silent tomb. Molluscoid aliens lie slumped across the floor in various states of decay. A postmortem reveals that they died from asphyxiation as the habitat's life support system was disabled, intentionally.\n\nTheir homes are fitted with unusual mechanical chairs that are hooked up to a central database in the shape of a gigantic blue orb - the Memorex."
 ancrel.4043.name:0 "The Memorex"
 ancrel.4043.desc:0 "The inhabitants had developed an enhanced learning program that ran every night as they slept in their mechanical chairs. It was used to remove unpleasant memories and train new skills. Being picked last for spaceball or stood up on a date were little day-to-day horrors the Ix Belènnians did not have to suffer to twice. And for a while it was bliss.\n\nSystematic mind enhancements were mandated by the habitat leadership and distributed to all residents from the Memorex. But the system was exploited. There were clandestine efforts to delete memories and traits collectively from the population without their consent and eventually it backfired. The aliens unlearned important skills for their survival and entered a vegetative state. Shortly thereafter the habitat life support was disabled."
 ancrel.4044.name:0 "Who am I?"
 ancrel.4044.desc:0 "A scan of the habitat's logs reveals its control system was activated again on multiple occasions decades after the life support was disabled. Someone overrode security, entered a maintenance hatch and accessed the Memorex. A datapad and a tiny blue memory orb - a smaller version of the Memorex - lie discarded by the hatch.\n\nThe datapad is filled with the frenzied thoughts of someone on the brink of madness. Again and again the same questions are repeated with growing despair: "who am I? What happened on Ix Belèn?" The final entry reads "now that I know I must forget one last time." Perhaps the orb will reveal what was forgotten."
 ancrel.4045.name:0 "Saariah's Last Memory Orb"
 ancrel.4045.desc:0 "The orb's first memory shows Dr. Saariah spearheading the development of the Memorex to great acclaim. Another memory from years later shows her secretly wiping Memorex data for unknown reasons. Yet another memory is of Saariah working frantically on restoring the residents' memories but to no avail. They stare emptily ahead, heads lolling, all but their autonomic brain functions lost.\n\nFinally admitting defeat she hides the evidence of her crimes. She watches, alone, as the Ix Belèn Residence is pulled into the gravity well of the gas giant it once orbited, feelers secreting large amounts of mucus in what is believed to be an alien expression of great distress."
 ancrel.4046.name:0 "The Temporary Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"
 ancrel.4046.desc:1 "The final memory shows a much older Saariah in a priest's robe waking up in a state of panic, tentacles flailing and ears flapping. She stumbles out of bed and begins to frantically jot down her recollections of yet another nightmare in which empty-eyed aliens convulse on a habitat floor.\n\nThen her face contorts with horror as it dawns upon her that it is all real - the nightmares and the flashbacks are extracted memories coming back to her. And if extracted memories can return, the inhabitants of Ix Belèn could have recovered. The maintenance hatch appears to have opened one last time but Saariah's ship still remains docked at the landing. We could bring the Memorex with us back to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName], if we wish."

 ancrel.13100.desc:0 "The discovery on [From.Planet.GetName] of vast canyons filled with mushrooms provided us with the beginning of an answer. The water is inside the mushrooms. They seem to span a large part of the surface of the world, all connected to the same mycelium, which technically makes it a single organism, and one of the biggest we've ever seen. Some of the members of the team dubbed this humongous fungus the 'Fumongus'.\n\nIt looks like the mushrooms have been genetically altered and have completely taken over the ecosystem that once existed here. Their unbridled and accelerated growth was such that they absorbed most of the water that was present here. They subsequently entered a sort of dried-up dormant state in which most of the fungus is still alive, with water spread out across the whole organism. "
 ancrel.13105.name:0 "Overrun Bunker"
 ancrel.13105.desc:0 "Deep in the heart of the mycelial forests nestled in the canyons of [From.Planet.GetName] we discovered some sort of bunker, long overrun by mushrooms. The team believes that it was built by the same species that genetically altered the mushrooms here. \n\nLarge sections of the bunker have collapsed and a lot of the equipment within it is likely broken beyond repair, but we have identified some sealed rooms that might hold exploitable material. Notably, no alien remains have been found here. Maybe they abandoned the place, or else didn't leave behind any body parts that weren't absorbed by the local wildlife. "

 ancrel.13110.desc:0 "The bunker on [From.Planet.GetName] was used to protect computing equipment, some of which appears to be directly connected to the mycelium. Thankfully, we managed to reactivate several terminals and databanks.\n\nBreaking the encryption and deciphering the language used will take time, and the team has requested that several of our top [Root.Owner.GetLinguists] be sent here to help."

 ancrel.13115.desc:0 "We have recovered valuable information from the databanks found in the bunker on [From.Planet.GetName]. The databanks tell us that this was a sort of listening post. Apparently, the aliens found a way to interpret the signals coursing through the mycelium and convert them into actionable intel.\n\nWe do not understand how this might have been possible, but the team will now try to bring water from nearby ice asteroids to 'awaken' the Fumongus again and see what kind data it transmits, if any."
 ancrel.13120.name:0 "Dry No More"
 ancrel.13120.desc:0 "The mushrooms on [From.Planet.GetName] are starting to flourish again. With the help of several other ships, we had to tow several icy asteroids into orbit before bringing down chunks of them to various places on the planet to melt. It has been long process, but it is finally beginning to bear fruit.\n\nWith this, the computers began to spit out small bits of data that seemed pretty random until we recognized activity from our home. In cooperation with teams on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName], a series of experiments has been conducted and the only possible conclusion is that the mushroom has some limited awareness of what happens on other planets. While the data we have retrieved is not exploitable just yet, continued efforts to restore the mushrooms are expected to give us more results."

 #Final event

 ancrel.13135.intro:0 "The Mycelium Listening Array is finally operational. A significant supply of water has been brought from orbit to sate the ever-thirsty mushroom, and major upgrades have been made to the computing resources."
 ancrel.13135.mid:0 "The number of signals traversing the network proved surprisingly low, considering the quantity of information conveyed. The most prominent theory posits that the Fumongus exists across dimensions where distances are not what we are used to.\nIn any case, the Fumongus is in contact with its offspring across the galaxy, and these smaller colonies are able to relay data, which we can then interpret."

Our more pessimistic [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] argue we might not be the only ones listening, and that by reactivating the network we just revealed ourselves to anyone using it.\n\nGiven all we still don't know about the Fumongus, or about the previous species that tapped into it, it might be best to just leave it alone.."
