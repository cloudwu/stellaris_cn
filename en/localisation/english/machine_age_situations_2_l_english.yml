 synth.505.desc: "Thanks to the efforts of our government, the consciousness of every willing citizen has been transferred into digital form. Synthesization has opened paths we cannot yet imagine, leading to new challenges and possibilities.\n\nBy focusing our efforts on the physical world, we could transport our digitized minds across great distances to a new body already prepared for us. Or we can come up with means to create remotely operated surrogate soldiers to alleviate the rigors of war."

 synth.510.desc: "While the synthesization has already affected society in ways we could have never anticipated, the general sentiment is that we could go even further. Our current synthetic bodies can be improved, or even discarded entirely for fully virtual existence.\n\nIf we decide to assign a synthetic body to everyone, it could enable officials to temporarily take over the bodies of ineffective members of the government. Alternatively, foregoing bespoke physical forms in favor of a fully virtual, communal experience would enable us to execute decisions with more efficiency than ever before."

Our organic past been left in the dust of history, but to charter a way forward, §Y[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]§! requires both the unconditional obedience of our brightest minds, and a decision.\n\nImproving our synthetic bodies would allow individuals to control multiple hosts as one.

Our synthetic bodies could become extensions of our identity, or mere tools to control remotely by our virtual consciousness. Our path is yet undecided.\n\nWe can research means to rapidly transfer a consciousness from one expendable body to another.

While we are entering a new, profitable frontier of synthesized future, we are also leaving our more materialistically aligned customer base behind. In a perfect world we would like to retain both segments in some capacity.\n\nAdvancements in synthesization-related fields such as artificial intelligence would allow us to imbue inanimate objects with rudimentary life, and launch multiple product lines.

### EVENT POOL 1: IDENTITY ###
 synth.610.name: "Synth Provenance"
 synth.610.desc: "The fundamental social changes brought on by synthesization are beginning to be felt. No longer limited by corporeal forms, we have radically redefined categories of gender, race, and bodily autonomy. While freeing for some, more traditional elements are reluctant to let go of the old framework; they desire a preset identity from which to operate.\n\nTo appease them, we could retain parts of our organic heritage in our synthetic form. Alternatively, we may want to allow the population to express their identity more freely."
 synth.610.a: "Maintain our original form."
 synth.610.b: "Allow unrestricted body modification."
 synth.610.c: "Enact moderate limits for identity customization."
 synth.610.d: "Visible status symbols must remain."
 synth.610.e: "Naturally this can be monetized...?"

 synth.620.name: "Organic Cravings"
 synth.620.desc: "Unenthusiastic about synthesization, some people look back with longing to their organic past. They argue that shorter lifespans and the innate imperfection of a "natural body" made life more meaningful.\n\nClaiming that their synthetic or virtual facsimiles feel impersonal and hollow, a group of hardliners are developing a cult-like devotion to organic bodies.\n\nPerhaps we should provide them a less perfect simulation in which to exist. Or would they prefer an imperfect shell?"
 synth.620.a: "Introduce planned imperfections to synth bodies."

 synth.630.name: "Home Server Architecture"
 synth.630.desc: "Synthesization of the entire §Y[root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! species has also meant a drastic shift in our housing practices; with minds resting easy in massive server farms, synthetic bodies can be stored in shelves. While this represents a cost-effective solution, some advocacy groups are raising some very real concerns.\n\nThe previously lucrative real-estate market could collapse entirely, leaving a considerable dent in our economy. Potentially more damaging, at least from a psychological perspective, is that people will no longer have a physical place to call home. "
 synth.630.a: "Centralized servers are most efficient."
 synth.630.b: "Individual servers can be stored in existing homes."
 synth.630.c: "Start selling digital homes."

 synth.1010.name: "Infinite Possibility Matrix"
 synth.1010.desc: "Digital industry is booming. From the thrill of simulating a first person adventure to relaxing on a digital resort, virtual entertainment has never been more engaging - or as addictive. While this burgeoning industry represents a key economic driver, production in the physical world has begun to suffer as people spend more and more time in their digital utopias. Some are in danger of losing touch with "real" life completely, but could still contribute to society by participating in the digital economy.\n\nShould we ban addictive virtual worlds, promote them as a new form of lucrative entertainment or find a middle ground through regulation?"

 synth.1010.b: "Promote these virtual paradises."
 synth.1010.b.hedonist: "Finally, the ultimate paradise!"
 synth.1010.c: "Regulate the industry."

 synth.1020.name: "Synthetic Medicine"
 synth.1020.desc: "Our new synthetic forms have freed us from ailments and injuries of the organic body. Unfortunately, they have also created a whole new set of issues, from simple mechanical breakdowns to life-threatening server stability, connection concerns, and digital viruses.\n\nShould we concentrate on protecting our digitized minds, regarding the body as a disposable commodity, or give it more attention as an extension of our identity?"
 synth.1020.a: "We must continue to protect the body."
 synth.1020.a.spiritual: "Body is a sacred container for the soul."
 synth.1020.b: "Concentrate on protecting the mind."
 synth.1020.b.spiritual: "We have already transcended the physical form."
 synth.1020.c: "Balance is the key."
 synth.1020.d: "These new ailments offer serious growth potential..."

 synth.1030.name: "Respawn"
 synth.1030.desc: "We have become faster, better, stronger. But subjecting synthetic bodies to dangerous situations still comes at a mental cost. Knowing that the mind can be restored may lessen the trauma, but does not remove it entirely. Especially as the retrieval is not always guaranteed. Neither can new bodies simply be manufactured out of thin air.\n\nWe can either disregard the psychological trauma to push the boundaries of synth performance or moderate our ambitions lest we endanger the mental wellbeing of the population."
 synth.1030.a: "Continue to push the limits."
