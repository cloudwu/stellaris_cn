Seeking new worlds to grow and exploit, they managed something that was - given our current understanding of xenobiology - believed impossible: they managed to implant our native flora and fauna into an alien planet, changing it to suit our population, through the use of enormous earthworks.\n\nAlthough replicating this success now is unlikely, as the changed planet was rather unique, it has shown that in time, we could enhance and adapt this process to suit other worlds.\n\nUntil then, we can allocate funds to grow the empire in other areas."
