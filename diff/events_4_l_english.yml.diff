NEW colony.3002.desc:1 "The mysteries of [event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName] have been revealed! A detailed survey revealed that the moon is slightly lopsided, with the far side of the moon having a disproportionately large share of the total mass. The reason for this, we believe, is that [event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName] once orbited another planet which was destroyed in a cataclysmic explosion.\n\nThe extra thickness on the far side of [event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName] is because that was the side which faced its original planet, the extra material is part of the mass of that planet which was blown into [event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName], knocking it out of orbit and sending it, eventually, into the orbit of [Root.GetName].\n\nWe speculate that the planet was destroyed by a weapon, or perhaps just an attempt to create a power source based on Dark Matter, as there are high concentrations of it in the planetary material coating the far side of the moon."

CN  colony.3002.desc:1 "[event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName]的神秘面纱终于被揭开了！详细勘探后发现该月球的倾角稍微偏移正轨，因此月球的远端拥有异常大的占重比。我们怀疑此现象的触发诱因是因为[event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName]曾经环绕着某个现已因剧烈爆炸而消失的行星公转的缘故。[event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName]的远端特别厚是因为那一段曾经是面向该行星的，而在行星爆炸时部分碎片冲击向[event_target:roguemoon.Planet.GetName]并合为一体，并且该冲击力最终将月球撞进[Root.GetName]的引力范围中。由于月球远端的地表上拥有较高浓度的暗物质，我们相信该爆炸的行星是被某种基于暗物质的武器或能源所毁灭。"
