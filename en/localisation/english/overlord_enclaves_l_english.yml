The proposal, first put forward by the fleet commanders, would result in us losing control of the fleet. We would also be responsible for providing them with a sizeable investment in §YEnergy Credits§! and §YAlloys§!. In return, they would give us a number of shares in the company.

The rest of the [FROM.GetName] collapsed quickly after, and their remaining fleets have disbanded. While some of the surviving captains may turn to piracy, others have announced their plans to honor smaller contracts, offering logistical support or space station garrisoning. But such trifling affairs are of little consequence. The important fact is that the Mercenary Enclave is no more, and from its wreckage we have been able to salvage a sizable amount of resources."
 enclave.26.desc:1 "Word has reached us that a Mercenary Enclave has been destroyed by the [mercenary_destroyer.GetName] in [merc_system.GetName]. The aggressors proved too strong for the [FROM.GetName] to face on their own, and the station housing the Board, barracks, and their shipyards was destroyed. The mercenary fleet disbanded shortly after, as every captain was left to fend for themselves, but some representatives have stated that they will honor the company's contracts in logistics and starbase garrisoning as best they can despite the dissolution of the Company."

 enclave.240.e:0 "The Contingency AI"
 enclave.245.desc:0 "The Khan's ships present an overall well rounded composition, with no clear weakness. Our analysts suggest that torpedoes might perform well to take their ships down, but caution against specialized defense. A mix of both shields and armor is probably your best bet to keep your ships alive. The Khan has proven to be an extremely competent commander and underestimating them would be a terrible mistake. Consider their retinue as an extreme menace."
 enclave.250.desc:0 "The Gray Tempest relies on two complementary weapon types: energy beams and strike craft. The former is countered by shields, but shields are bypassed by their strike craft. Our projections show that ships fitted with point defense in addition to shields have a much better chance to survive the engagement. Nanite ships are extremely well protected, but torpedoes might help in breaching their defenses."
 enclave.255.desc:0 "Prethoryn fleets rely on slow moving projectiles and hosts of smaller ships to take down their foes. One option to fend them off is to use point defense, coupled with armor and improvements to your ship's hull resilience; another is to engage them at extreme range. With sufficiently powerful energy weapons, one might manage to destroy their fleets before they can even get in range."
 enclave.260.desc:0 "The Unbidden's exclusive reliance on energy gives us an obvious weakness to exploit. Weapons dealing extra damage to their shields should prove devastating, but if you can fit weapons that completely bypass their shields, they won't be long for this dimension. Defensively, you should look at bringing your own shields to the fight to adequately counter their energy beams."
 enclave.265.desc:0 "Contingency ships exclusively use energy weapons- as such, it is best to use shields to mitigate incoming damage. Simulations indicate that despite having strong defense, their ship's hulls are relatively fragile. Our analysts estimate that penetrating weapons might perform very well against them."

 # Introductions
 enclave.7000.title:0 "[shroudwalker_enclave_country.GetName]"
 enclave.7000.desc:0 "Fellow travelers, we greet you.\n\nYour presence on the galactic stage has long been known to us, but until now, afraid we might unduly influence your destiny, we have held back. However, the time has come to lift the veil; the ways of the Shroud may seem strange and unnerving to the uninitiated, and it is for this reason that we offer guidance. Realize that you have someone willing to be your teacher, if you so wish.\n\nWander safely, until our next encounter."
 enclave.7000.a:0 "Interesting..."

 enclave.7005.title:0 "[salvager_enclave_country.GetName]"
 enclave.7005.desc:0 "We've been hearing rumors about the impressive [Root.GetName] for a while now, and we're pleased to make your acquaintance!\n\nFor a nominal contribution of credits, we of the [salvager_enclave_country.GetName] offer premium salvager services. From engine upgrades to scrapping fleets, whatever your needs, you can count on us!\n\nAnd to ensure that we start off in your good graces, how about a small gift to show our commitment to customer service?"
 enclave.7005.a:0 "We thank you for the gift."
 enclave.7005.b:0 "A gift is only to be expected, xeno."

 enclave.7050.desc:0 "A saying is known to us: 'Secrets dance in dreams.' To the Shroud, no vault is impenetrable, no code unbreakable. In our meditations, what others believe hidden is often laid bare. Would it interest you to learn what your peers are plotting? To know their designs as if they were your own? Should you wish it, we will share our insights. How you make use of them is up to you."

 enclave.7060.desc:0 "It is said that within the Shroud every mind casts its shadow. During our meditations, the wavering of a certain mind was laid bare to us, a trusted voice whose loyalty is not as steadfast as it appears. Their duplicity is your gain. No doubt they will prove a willing asset."

 enclave.7065.desc:0 "You have many skilled agents in your employ, but each is bound by their own limitations. An eye cannot perceive itself. The Shroud knows no such boundaries; our meditations have revealed much. If your clandestine operations are to thrive, you would do well to heed our advice."
 enclave.7065.tt:0 "Increased our Spy Network §YInfiltration Level§! in the §H[from.GetName]§!."

 enclave.7100.desc:1 "Mastery of the Shroud is a journey of 10,000 lifetimes; even our most gifted teachers can claim only partial knowledge of its mysteries. Nevertheless, their wisdom is invaluable. Should you wish it, we will dispatch one to guide your course."
 enclave.7100.a:0 "We wish to learn."

 enclave.7105.desc:1 "To know that there is always more to know: this is the highest wisdom. A teacher will be sent to you. Learn well, and you will surely reap the rewards."

 enclave.7110.desc:0 "A most interesting story. §YVeilfarer§!, you said? In some ways, this coven does resemble our own, but while these differences may appear subtle to the uninitiated, they are profound: a distorted reflection, from an universe not quite like our own.\n\nThe Shroud has many tears on its surface.
