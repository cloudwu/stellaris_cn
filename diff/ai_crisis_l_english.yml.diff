After being subjected to divine light by a Colossus, the planet's AI Core self-destructed before its final systems failed, using a massive anti-matter device hidden deep beneath the surface.

All surviving Contingency warforms have either powered down or self-destructed, and the Ghost Signal is no longer being transmitted.\n\nThe main nexus was exposed to a divine enforcer beam from a Colossus, which triggered a self-destruction mechanism from the AI Core. Traveling outwards at lightspeed, the intense light from the energy discharge will be visible to future generations for millennia to come as a bright, short-lived star.\n\nAcross the galaxy, sapient beings are united in their celebration of this great victory. For the moment, at least, the future looks bright."
